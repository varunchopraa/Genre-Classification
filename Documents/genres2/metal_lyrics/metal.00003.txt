Racing down the road
In a street machine of steel
Gears are jammed in full
I'm the madman at the wheel
Got my foot pinned to the floor
You can feel the engine roar
I got thunder in my hands
I'm metal thrashing mad, yeah
Metal thrashing mad, yeah
Driving like a maniac
Can't go any faster
Burning up the road
Headed for disaster
Got my foot pinned to the floor
You can feel the engine roar
Got thunder in my hands
I'm metal thrashing mad
