Colours burst in wild explosions;
Fiery, flaming shades of fall
All in accord with my pounding heart
Behold the autumnweaver
In bronze and yellow dying
Colours unfold into dreams
In hordes of a thousand and one
The bleeding
Unwearing their masks to the last notes of summer
Their flutes and horns in nightly swarming
Colours burst within
Spare me those unending fires!
Bestowed upon the flaming shades of fall
September flies beyond our reach
As the flames reborn their fall
October is the art we teach
With the Flaming Shades of Fall
November,
Robe of prophet - heart of false redeemer
Night whispers as the flaming shades of fall now die
Darkness, wild and unchained
Towards its heart we plunge
We must crush the false redeemer
With the flaming shades of fall
