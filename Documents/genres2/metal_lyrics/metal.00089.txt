Apokalips
Black finger tips
Slides in and out her mouth
The darkest thrill
Is quick instilled
Upon her waiting tongue
Yeah, yeah
Death's head in the afterglow
Smiling in the sun
A revolution
The thickest rain
A poison gray
Bullet on the way
Thermal haze
Rain all day
Blot out all the sun
She sees the world
In all its pain
Its glittering demise
Apokalips
Dementia kiss
Ultraviolet sky
Yeah, yeah
Death's head in the afterglow
Smiling in the sun
A revolution
Yeah, yeah
Death's head in the afterglow
Smiling in the sun
All I really ever loved
I got there in your hole
Yeah
