Shining metal
Arc of light
Red eyes
Smell of fear
Deep cut
Red stream
On white skin
In slowmotion
Stop time
Close your lips
Keep the word
Lay down and sleep
With bleeding heart
I'll take you away
Save you from
The claws of time
Die by my hand, die by my hand
Now you are
A crystal rose
Frozen for
Eternity
Down on my knees
Caress your body
Inside my head
In slowmotion
Stop time
Close your lips
Keep the word
Lay down and sleep
With bleeding heart
I'll take you away
Save you from
The claws of time
Die by my hand, die by my hand
Die by my hand
