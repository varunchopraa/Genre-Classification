Won't you come into my parlor, make yourself at home
The kinescope is waiting and you're in for quite a show
Direct your gaze to a device across the room
I think you'll be amazed when you see what it can do

Hidden thoughts, secret fears, things you think I'd never know
Oh friend there's not a single thought I wasn't privy to
A mirror to your soul when you ask it tells the truth
It'll show you all and more than you want it to

There's a world here to show you but so little time to share
The Kinescope is waiting and I've saved a seat for you
There's a world here to show you but so little time to share
The Kinescope is waiting and I've saved a seat for you

Right here

We all deceive ourselves sometimes
Refusing to look at the darkness inside
Examine your soul and you will see
That you're not the one
That you wanted to be

There's a world here to show you but so little time to share
The Kinescope is waiting and I've saved a seat for you
There's a world here to show you but so little time to share
The Kinescope is waiting and I've saved a seat for you
Right here, right here
