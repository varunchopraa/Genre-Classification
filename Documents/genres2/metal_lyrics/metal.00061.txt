It's the same old song
You've gotta be somewhere at sometime
They never let you fly
It's like broken glass
You get cut before you see it
So open up your eyes
You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the power
Stand up and shout, shout
Stand up and shout, shout
You've got wings of steel
But they never really move you
You only seem to crawl
You've been nailed to the wheel
But never really turning
You know you've got to want it all
You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the power
Stand up and shout, shout
Stand up and shout
Let it out
You are the strongest chain
And not just some reflection
So never hide again
You are the driver
You own the road
You are the fire go on explode
You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the power
Stand up and shout
Stand up and shout
Let it out
Stand up and shout
