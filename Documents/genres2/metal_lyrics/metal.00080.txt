Midnight street magic, crazy people, crazy sound

Ziggy, Benny and the Jets
Take a rocket, we just gotta fly
(I can take you through the center of the dark)
We're gonna fly (on a collision course to crash into my heart)
I will be your, I will be your, I'll be your
Rocket, yeah, satellite of love
Rocket, yeah, satellite of love
