The giant's lost
And all round him
Destructed for what
They all knew what it meant
But they couldn't change it
Lord they had gone too far
Leave them alone
It's all gone
What is left behind
On a desert we called earth
When the last whale went away
Did they ever see the tears
Don't fear Your last step
From the theatre of pain
And the children will love Your singing
From the sea
The sea is calling
Now we've to leave it
The sea was clear
On the day I was stranded
Answers I'd known
To keep this all alive
But I can't change it
Forever
Now I'm gone
And it seems that life had never existed
So we left the dark and cold
All I left behind are my tears
Don't fear Your last step
From the theatre of pain
And the children will love Your singing
From the sea
The sea is calling
I hear them calling
