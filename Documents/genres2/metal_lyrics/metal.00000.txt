I travel over high mountains
Through deep valleys and forests
Crossing great rivers
In search of knowledge of the gods
From far beyond place and time
I hear a whispering wind
It tells me to strive on
Through the horizon of my thoughts

I am the mindtraveller
My quest is man's destiny
Teach me secret holy spells
And the wisdom of the elderly
Gazing into my mind
Entering my soul
Is there not a secret to unfold

I am the mindtraveller
Seeking wisdom of yore
I am the mindexplorer
Striving to know so much more
Spirits of history fill my soul
With divine old words
I am on the right track
Out of the haze I'll emerge

I reach unknown corners
In the back of my mind
Never been here before
Still I recognise it all
I hear the whispering voices
Clearly all around me
Echoing in the valley
Where magic intellect dwells

I am the mindtraveller
My quest is man's destiny
Teach me secret holy spells
And the wisdom of the elderly
Gazing into my mind
Entering my soul
Is there not a secret to unfold
Gazing into my mind
Entering my soul
Here i have advice to be told

I travel over high mountains
Through deep valleys and forests
Crossing great rivers
In search of knowledge of the gods
Finally I can see the blind
Not knowing why they exists
I hear laments of nature
Where led the path we missed?

I am the mindtraveller
My quest is man's destiny
Teach me secret holy spells
And the wisdom of the elderly
Gazing into my mind
Entering my soul
Is there not a secret to unfold
Gazing into my mind
Entering my soul
Here i have advice to be told
