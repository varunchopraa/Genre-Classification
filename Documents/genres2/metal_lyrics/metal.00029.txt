The glamour boys swear they are a diva
The glamour boys have it all under control
Always dancing and always laughing
The glamour boys are playing the role
The glamour boys never have no money
The glamour boys wear the most expensive clothes
The glamour boys are always at the party
Where the money comes from heaven only knows
I ain't no glamour boy - I'M FIERCE
I ain't no glamour boy - (snap)
I ain't no glamour boy - I'M FIERCE
I ain't no glamour boy
The glamour boys live off their ambition
The glamour boys have it all figured out
A very, very dubious position
When you got no clout
The glamour boys whole life is a gamble
They might get over or fall flat on their face
But if one does, there's no need to worry
Another G-Boy will take this place
I ain't no glamour boy - I'M FIERCE
The glamour boys don't think tomorrow
The glamour boys just need tonight to play
But just like things you can't afford on credit
Time catches up and you have to pay
The glamour boys are always on the guest list
You'll always find them in the hottest spots in town
They'll be your friend if you have fame or fortune
If you don't they won't be hanging 'round
I ain't no glamour boy - I'M FIERCE
