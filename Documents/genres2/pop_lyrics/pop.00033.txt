My heart, won't skip, a beat
I never look, before, I leap
Ride, just enjoy the ride
Don't need a reason why
Everything's all right

Buy buy buy buy
Buy buy buy buy
The joy of Pepsi

The world goes 'round and 'round

But some things never change

Buy buy buy buy
Buy buy buy buy
The joy of Pepsi

Look, look and you will find
This taste is on my mind
And I won't be denied
And you will find
