Crazy
Oh, oh, oh oh

Baby, I'm so into you
You got that something, what can I do?
Baby, you spin me around, oh
The earth is moving, but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumping, it's easy to see

You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night
Oh, oh

Tell me you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wasting my feelings on you
Every time I look at you, my heart is jumping
What can I do?

You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night

Oh, oh yeah, yeah
You drive me crazy, oh
Sing it, oh, crazy, yeah
Yeah, stop
Ooh, oh, yeah

You drive me crazy, baby
Excited, I'm in too deep, oh
Oh, my, it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night
You drive me crazy (You drive me crazy)
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep (Deep, baby)
Oh, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night
Sing it, crazy, oh
Oh, crazy, ooh, oh, yeah
You drive me crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night!
