Oh God you know everything, remember us
Teach us the way, which will lead you
If it reaches you, this prayer of mine
You will listen to it and save us
We are your children
The light that you have
(I pray you'll be my light)
In the heart will remain
(And watch us where we go)
to remind us that
(And help us to be wise)
Eternal star you are
In my prayer
(Let this be our prayer)
How much faith there is
(When we lose our way)
If you guide us, you will save us
Our eyes are yours
We dream of a world without violence
A world of justice and hope
Everyone give his neighbor's hand
Symbol of peace, of fraternity
The strength it gives us
It is the desire that
everyone finds love
Around and within itself
This my prayer, we turn to you
It is the faith that you have kindled in us
I feel it will save us
It is the faith that you have kindled in us
I feel it will save us
