Ah, ah ah
Ah, ah ah
There's days
I'm away
Because I'm down with you everyday
There you say
Break away
I'm missing out on the fun and games
But you smile
And no words they tell me
Quit with this appeal
You speak and there is no other
Voice that I can hear
I spend my days
With you
I spend my days (I spend my nights) my nights
(Thinking about you) thinkin' about you
all day, all night
(With you) with you
(I spend my nights) my nights
(Thinkin' about you)
You're so fine
On my mind
And I think about you
All the time
Day and night
Feels so right
And for us there is no end in sight
Ooh, each day that I spend around you
Passes by too fast
Each night
That I spend without you
Is longer than the last
I spend my days
(With you) thinking about you
(I spend my nights) my nights
(Thinkin' about you) all day, all night
my days
(With you) thinking about you
(I spend my nights) my nights
(Thinkin' about you) thinking about you, baby
Ooh, you know I can't get
Enough of you
Can't get enough, yeah
Oh, oh, you know that twenty-four hours
Won't ever, ever do, yeah
I spend my days
(With you) with you, with you
(I spend my nights) my nights
Thinkin' about you
I spend my days
(With you) with you baby
(I spend my nights) all day, all night
(Thinkin' about you) all day, all night
thinking about you
(With you) thinking about you
(I spend my nights) thinking about you
(Thinkin' about you) thinking about you
thinking about you
(With you) thinking about you
(I spend my nights) thinking about you
(Thinkin' about you) thinking about you
all day all night
(With you) all day, all night
(I spend my nights)
(Thinkin' about you) ooh yeah
(I spend my days)
(With you) with you baby
