chin chin chin chin
wanna chase the machine
bling bling
wanna be in a scene
a big shot on a small screen
we got all the gold and the green
chin chin chin chin
wanna chase the machine
bling bling wanna be in a scene
a big shot on a small screen
we got all the gold and the green
now or never, say whatever
call somebody or call me clever
the style stirrer, multicolor mirror
with tambourine and guiro
come nearer, let me make it clearer
my amigo, my chiquita
light a flicker put your lyrics on a sticker
skip the filter, blast the meter, tear the speaker
shake your shake your sneaker
shake it shake it quicker
