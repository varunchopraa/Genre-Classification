Time may take us apart, but I will still love you, I promise
Oh
Oh yeah
And when the stars, stars are falling
I'll keep calling
I promise that you'll be my one, my only everything
I'll never be untrue
And I promise that for all your love I will do anything
I will give you the stars, I will buy you the moon
Even through the longest of our nights
And even through the darkest days
Our love will find a way
And when the stars are falling
I'll keep calling
I will still love you
And when your dreams are fading
I'll be waiting
I will still love you
You were my summer breeze, my winter sun, my
Springtime soul (springtime soul), my autumn touch of gold, yeah
And you were my sky, my rain, the earth in which my love goes strong
The smile of my heart and the breath of my soul
Even if we find ourselves apart
We will hold our hopes and dreams
Forever in our hearts
And when the stars are falling (stars are falling)
I'll keep calling (I'll keep calling)
I will still love you (I will still love you)
And when your dreams are fading (dreams are fading)
I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
I will still love you
Tell me how you feel
I finally know how love feels
Tell me if it's real
And my heart tells me it's real
So real, so real
And when the stars are falling (stars are falling)
I'll keep calling (I'll keep calling)
I will still, I will still love you (I will still love you)
And when your dreams are fading
I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
I will still love you (I will still love you baby)
Time may take us apart, that's true
But I will always be there for you
You're in my heart, you'll be in my dreams
No matter how many miles we've seen
I promise you that I won't forget
The day we kissed or the day we met
The sky may fall and the stars may tilt
But I will still, I will still love you
And when the stars are falling
I'll keep calling
I will still love you (I will still love you)
And when your dreams are fading
I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
I will still love you
