All my friends are gonna party all night long
C'mon over, c'mon over baby. [Repeat: x4]
Hey boy don't you know
I've got something going on (Yes I do)
I've got an invitation, don't you keep me waiting all night long
I know, you know, so baby don't pretend you won't give me
Kiss and hug
I will or you won't, don't want to play that game with you baby
So boy won't you come?
We will party till the dawn.
So listen to me
All I want is you (Come over here baby)
All I want is you (You make me go crazy)
All I want is you (Now baby don't be shy, you better cross the line)
I'm gonna love you right (All I want is you!)
C'mon over, c'mon over, baby. [Repeat: x2]
I want you to know you could be the one for me (Yes, you could)
You've got all I'm looking for
You've got personality
I know, you know, I'm gonna give more
But boy, you know, I never felt this way before
So, boy won't you come?
So, boy won't you come
And open the door?
