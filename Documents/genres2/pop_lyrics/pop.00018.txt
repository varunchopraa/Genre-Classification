I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye.
Thinking of you
And the love of our lives
In the sweet summertime
so sad but true (so true, so true)
We must leave it behind in our heart in our mind.
From April through September
Bittersweet was the love that we shared don't forget I remember
I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye.
I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye.
Memories can make (they can make)
But my heart has a place for the smile on your face
And maybe someday (someday)
We can be more than friends love will find us again.
Red leaves and blue tomorrows
Time will give back the love that we shared on the time that we borrowed
I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye.
I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye.
From April through September
Bittersweet was the love that we shared don't forget I remember
We leave behind, the sum my time, our hearts our minds
They will remind, we won't forget
The day we met
The day we cried ooh
Autumn goodbye
I never promised you a happy ending
You never said you wouldn't make me cry
But summer love will keep us warm long after
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye.
