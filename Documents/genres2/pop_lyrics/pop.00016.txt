I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no satisfaction
When I'm drivin' in my car
And that man comes on the radio
He's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, oh no no no
Hey hey hey, this what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no reaction
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try, baby
I can't get no
I can't get no satisfaction
When I'm watchin' my TV
And that girl comes on and tells me
How tight my skirts should be
She can't tell me who to be
'Cause I've got my own identity
I can't get no, oh no no no
I can't get no uh, satisfaction
I can't get no uh, satisfaction
I can't get no uh, satisfaction
I can't get no uh, satisfaction
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I just can't get no
I can't get no (ooh yeah yeah yeah), satisfaction (no, no, no)
I can't get no (I can't get no), satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no (I can't get no) satisfaction
I can't get no (I can't get no) satisfaction (I need your satisfaction)
I can't get no (ooh baby) satisfaction
I can't get no
I can't get no (no matter what I do, no matter what I say)
Satisfaction (everywhere I go they say it's not okay)
I can't get no (no matter what I do, no matter what I say)
Satisfaction (everywhere I go they say it's not okay)
I can't get no satisfaction (this is what I say)
I can't get no, I can't get no satisfaction, baby
I can't get no 9I can't get no satisfaction, baby)
