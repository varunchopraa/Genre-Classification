Our objective of this meeting today Is to discuss Destiny's Child's
Commandments of relationships
You know it's so unfortunate, so unnecessary
For us to end up with brokenhearts
Yes Godfather
Times have changed
Relationships aren't like the old days
You know?
See what we need is a man of his word
All this, uh cheating, uh backstabbing, uhm hating
No more, no more
But Godfather, how do we avoid all these mishaps?
It's obvious,
The Writing's On The Wall;
Thou shalt not hate
