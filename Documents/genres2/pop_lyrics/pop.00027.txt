Oh, my love
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
I'm sitting here alone up in my room
I'm thinking 'bout the times that we've been through, oh, my love
I'm looking at a picture in my hand
Trying my best to understand
I really wanna know what we did wrong
With a love that felt so strong
If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one within in my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
I know I've been a fool since you've been gone
I'd better give it up and carry on, oh, my love
'Cause living in a dream of you and me
Is not the way my life should be
I don't want to cry a tear for you
So forgive me if I do (Ooh)
If only you were here tonight
I know that we could make it right
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one within in my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
I'd do anything
I'd give you my world
I'd wait forever to be your girl (Just call out my name)
Just call out my name (and I will be there) and I will be there (Ooh)
Just to show you how much I care (Alright, ooh)
I was born to make you happy, yeah (Ooh, ooh yeah)
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
'Cause you're the only one within in my heart
I was born to make you happy
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
I was born to make you happy
(Oh yeah, oh, oh yeah)
Always and forever, you and me
That's the way our life should be
I don't know how to live without your love
I was born to make you happy
