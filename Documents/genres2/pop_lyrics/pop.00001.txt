Baby who was the one that treated you
So badly you felt like you
Had to do that you were cheating
I felt for you
Till you proved everything that my friends said about you
About you was true
You got your lady
And happened your way
So can you blame me
For walking away
What did I do
To be treated so bad
Now that you have loved me
I was the best thing you ever had
Do you think I don't know, what's going on
But I know we're through I just keep wasting my time
I have you holding on but I know wer're through I just keep wasting my time
Can't you see that the things you said and did
Never have been make believe
That you thought you saw the surer side of me
Now you seem to think that you can't seem to live your life without me
Sorry but baby you can't do it to me
You got your lady
And happened your way
So can you blame me
For walking away
What did I do
To be treated so bad
Now you have loved me
I was the best thing you ever had
Do you think I don't know, what's going on
But I know we're through I just keep wasting my time
I have you holding on but I know wer're through I just keep wasting my time
Do you think I don't know, what's going on
But I know we're through I just keep wasting my time
I have you holding on but I know wer're through I just keep wasting my time
Now you know I can live without you
You should see that it's not all about you
This time you played too late again
Now it's time to see
That I won't waste my life about you
Do you think I don't know, what's going on
But I know we're through I just keep wasting my time
I have you holding on but I know wer're through I just keep wasting my time
Do you think I don't know, what's going on
But I know we're through I just keep wasting my time
I have you holding on but I know wer're through I just keep wasting my time
Do you think I don't know, what's going on
But I know we're through I just keep wasting my time
I have you holding on but I know wer're through I just keep wasting my time
Do you think I don't know, what's going on
But I know we're through I just keep wasting my time
I have you holding on but I know wer're through I just keep wasting my time
Do you think I don't know, what's going on
But I know we're through I just keep wasting my time
I have you holding on but I know wer're through I just keep wasting my time
Do you think I don't know, what's going on
But I know we're through I just keep wasting my time
I have you holding on but I know we're through I just keep wasting my time
