The desert I wonder lacks its mirage
There's no mistaking a barrage
Of sand and wind like it tears my skin (?)
Baby what's without exposing what's within
Forsaken left here
In my barren desolate
My soul is evaporating won't you saturate me won't you saturate me
Rain down on me with life
My soul is evaporating won't you saturate me won't you saturate me
Storm over me bring the tide
My days stretched long into the heat
As the sun brightens my defeat
My lips are chapped they're parched and dry
Ooh yeah yeah
My first it felt with everyday gone by
Forsaken left here
In my barren desolate
My soul is evaporating won't you saturate me won't you saturate me
Rain down on me with life
My soul is evaporating won't you saturate me won't you saturate me
Storm over me bring the tide
The dunes that shift, drifted lift in the wind
Cover up my hope as I start to give in
To the cracks and creases and the dips in my will
As I am pushed to the brink I drink down and swill
My soul is evaporating won't you saturate me won't you saturate me
Rain down on me with life
My soul is evaporating won't you saturate me won't you saturate me
Storm over me bring the tide
My soul is evaporating won't you saturate me won't you saturate me
Rain down on me with life
Ahhaoah
