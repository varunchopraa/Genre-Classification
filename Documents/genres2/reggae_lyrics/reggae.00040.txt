Girl, you want some summer, some summer
Some summer, some summer

Down by the lakeside, then we went to this party
Down by the lakeside, then we went to this party
Everyone was feeling alright
Everyone was doing reggae (reggae, reggae, reggae)
Everyone was doing the wine
Everyone was doing the funk
What a loving day, for you and me today
What a loving day, for you and me today
Girl, what a loving day, for you and me today
For you and me, today
For you and me, today
Maybe, in some future, we can do it again, together
Ah you and me, yes, you and me
Ah you and me, yes, you and me
You make my day
So, I should take you home, to your
Home sweet home, home sweet home
What a loving day
