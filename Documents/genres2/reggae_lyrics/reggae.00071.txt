Say when I'm ready you must hold on steady
We're moving off at lightening speed, yeah
Take a seat and wait 'till I'm ready
I'm coming so hold on steady, yeah
Big ship sailing on the ocean
We don't need no commotion
Big ship sailing on the ocean
Big ship sailing on the ocean
Big ship sailing on the ocean
There's a time when the sea gets rough
The wind is blowing and the fishes keep movin'
What are you doing mister man
Sit down hold on tight, get ready 'cause you're sailing
Big ship sailing on the ocean
We don't need no commotion
Big ship sailing on the ocean
Get ready 'cause we're moving
