Get up in the morning, slaving for bread, sir
So that every mouth can be fed
Poor, poor me, Israelites. Aah

Get up in the morning, slaving for bread, sir
So that every mouth can be fed
Poor me, the Israelite

My wife and my kids, they packed up and leave me
Darling, she said, "I was yours to be seen"
Poor me, the Israelite

Shirt them a-tear up, trousers are gone
I don't want to end up like Bonnie and Clyde
Poor me, the Israelite

After a storm there must be a calm
They catch me in the farm
You sound your alarm
Poor a-poor a-poor me, the Israelite
