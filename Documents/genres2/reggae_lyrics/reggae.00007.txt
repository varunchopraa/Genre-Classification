One Love! One Heart!
Let's get together and feel all right
Hear the children cryin' (One Love!)
Hear the children cryin' (One Heart!)
Sayin': give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right
Sayin': let's get together and feel all right. Wo wo-wo wo-wo!

Let them all pass all their dirty remarks (One Love!)
There is one question I'd really love to ask (One Heart!)
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own beliefs?

One Love! What about the one heart? One Heart!
What about - ? Let's get together and feel all right
As it was in the beginning (One Love!)
So shall it be in the end (One Heart!)
All right!
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right
Let's get together and feel all right
One more thing!

Let's get together to fight this Holy Armageddon (One Love!)
So when the Man comes there will be no, no doom (One Song!)
Have pity on those whose chances grows thinner
There ain't no hiding place from the Father of Creation

Sayin': "One Love"! What about the One Heart? (One Heart!)
What about the - ? Let's get together and feel all right
I'm pleadin' to mankind! (One Love!)
Oh, Lord! (One Heart) Wo-ooh!

Let's get together and feel all right
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right
