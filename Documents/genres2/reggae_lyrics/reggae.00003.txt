Don't worry about a thing,
Cause every little thing gonna be all right.
Singin: don't worry about a thing,
Cause every little thing gonna be all right!
Rise up this mornin,
Smiled with the risin sun,
Three little birds
Pitch by my doorstep
Singin sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true,
Sayin, (this is my message to you-ou-ou:)
Singin: don't worry bout a thing,
Cause every little thing gonna be all right.
Singin: don't worry (dont worry) bout a thing,
Cause every little thing gonna be all right!
