No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
'Cause I remember when we used to sit
In a government yard in trenchtown
Observing the hypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have, now
Good friends we have lost
Along the way
In this great future,
You can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
Oh little darling, don't shed no tears
No woman no cry
'Cause I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in trenchtown
When Georgie would make the fire lights
I say, log would burnin' through the nights
Everything 's gonna be alright
Everything 's gonna be alright
Everything 's gonna be alright now
Everything 's gonna be alright
Everything 's gonna be alright now
Everything 's gonna be alright
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
Oh little darlin' don't shed no tears
No woman no cry
Oh little darlin' don't shed no tears
No woman no cry
Said I re', said I re', Said I remember
No woman no cry
You and I and you and I and you and I
No woman no cry
Then I remember when we used to sit there
No woman no cry
In a government yard
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry, yeah
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry
No woman no cry, yeah
No woman no cry
