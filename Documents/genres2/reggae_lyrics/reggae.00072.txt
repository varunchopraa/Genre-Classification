I read these things in prophecy!
Oh-oh!

Looks like the sun, it doesn’t shine for me
Still I’m a-living, trying to be free
But freedom is a must i know, no matter how they fuss and go on
Because I read these things in prophecy

When the rain stop falling down and they’ve got no water
They gonna bow down to the ground, wishing that they were under
And when the stars start falling down and fire’s burning, (red hot)
There will be weeping and a gnashing of teeth ‘cause everyone will be
Mourning
A whole lot of people will be mourning, everyone will be mourning
Seen a few will be mourning!

Looks like the moon, it doesn’t shine for me. (Wonder why?)
I’ve always tried to do right in the people’s sight? Oh well!
But freedom is a messiah now, no matter how they fuss and go on!
Because I read these things in prophecy

Here’s what it says!
When the rain stop falling down and they’ve got no water
They gonna bow down to the ground, wishing that they were under
And when the stars start falling down and fire’s burning, (rey dat)
There will be weeping and a gnashing of teeth ‘cause everyone will be
Mourning
A whole lot of people will be mourning, everyone will be mourning
Seen a few will be mourning, everyone will be mourning. Oh well!

Say!
Looks like the sun, it doesn’t shine for me
Still I’m a-living, trying to be free
But freedom is a messiah now, no matter how they fuss and go on
Because I read these things in prophecy

When the rain stop falling down and they’ve got no water, (What they
Gonna drink?)
They gonna bow down to the ground, wishing that they were under. (Oh well!)
And when the stars start falling down and fire’s burning, (rey dat)
There will be weeping and a gnashing of teeth ‘cause everyone will be
Mourning

Looks like the moon, it doesn’t shine for me. (Late at night!)
All I’ve tried to do is good in the people’s sight
But freedom is a must tonight, no matter how they fuss and fight!
Because I read these things in prophecy

Here’s what it says!
When the rain stop falling down and they’ve got no water
They gonna bow down to the ground, wishing that they were under
