Early this morning
As I came up the stairs
Had something on my mind to say
Everyone was talking how everything was getting on
Is there any some solutions, carry on
Them crazy, them crazy
We gonna chase those crazy
Baldheads out of town
Chase those crazy baldheads
Out of town
I and I build the cabin
I and I plant the corn
Didn't my people before me
Slave for this country
Now you look me with your scorn
Then you eat up all my corn
We gonna chase those crazy
Chase those crazy
Chase those crazy baldheads
Chase those crazy, Lord, lordy
Chase those crazy baldheads out of town
Build your penitentiary, we build your schools
So brainwash education, tryin' to make us your fools
Hate is your reward for our love
Yelling at us of your God above
We gonna chase those crazy
Chase those crazy
Chase those crazy baldheads
Chase those crazy
Chase those crazy baldheads out of town
Here come the conman
Coming with his con plan
We won't take no bribe, we got to stay alive
We're gonna
Chase those crazy
Chase those crazy
Chase those crazy, come on, come with me
Chase those crazy baldheads out of the town
