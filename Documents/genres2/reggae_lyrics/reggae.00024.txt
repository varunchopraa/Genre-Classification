Man to man is so unjust, children
You don't know who to trust
Your worst enemy could be your best friend
And your best friend your worst enemy
Some will eat and drink with you
Then behind them su-su 'pon you
Only your friend know your secrets
So only he could reveal it
And who the cap fit
Let them wear it
And who the cap fit
Let them wear it
Said I throw me corn (throw me corn)
Me no call no fowl (me no call no fowl)
I saying Cok-cok-cok (Cok-cok-cok)
Cluck-cluck-cluck (Cluck-cluck-cluck)
Ay
Some will hate you, pretend they love you now
Then behind they try to eliminate you
But who Jah bless, no one curse
Thank God
We're past the worse
Hypocrites and parasites
Will come up and take a bite
And if your night should turn to day
A lot of people would run away
And who the cap fit
Let them wear it
Who the cap fit
Let them wear it
And then I'm gonna throw me corn (throw me corn)
And then I'm gonna call no fowl (call no fowl)
And then I'm gonna say Cok-cok-cok (Cok-cok-cok)
Cluck-cluck-cluck (Cluck-cluck-cluck)
Some will eat and drink with you
Then behind them su-su 'pon you (su-su 'pon you)
And if night should turn to day
A lot of people will run away
And who the cap fit
Let them wear it
And who the cap fit
Let them wear it
Throw me corn (Throw me corn)
Me no call no fowl (me no call no fowl)
I saying cok-cok-cok (cok-cok-cok)
Cluck-cluck-cluck (Cluck-cluck-cluck)
I gotta cok-cok-cok (cok-cok-cok)
Cluck-cluck-cluck
