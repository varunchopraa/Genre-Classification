So much trouble in the world
So much trouble in the world
Bless my eyes this morning
Jah sun is on the rise once again
The way earthly things are going
Anything can happen
You see men sailing on their ego trips
Blast off on their spaceships
Million miles from reality
No care for you, no care for me
So much trouble in the world
So much trouble in the world
All you've got to do is give a little (give a little)
Give a little (give a little)
Give a little (give a little)
One more time yeah! (give a little)
Yeah! (give a little) yeah! (give a little) yeah!
So you think you've found the solution
But it's just another illusion
So before you check out this tide
Don't leave another cornerstone standing there behind
We've got to face the day
Ooh we come what may
We the street people talking
Yeah, we the people struggling
Now they are sitting on a time bomb (bomb, bomb, bomb! bomb, bomb, bomb!)
Now I know the time has come (bomb, bomb, bomb! bomb, bomb, bomb!)
What goes on up is coming on down (bomb, bomb, bomb! bomb, bomb, bomb!)
Goes around and comes around (bomb, bomb, bomb! bomb, bomb, bomb!)
So much trouble in the world
So much trouble in the world
So much trouble in the world
There is so much trouble (so much trouble in the world)
There is so much trouble
There is so much trouble (so much in the world)
There is so much trouble
There is so much trouble in the world
There is (so much in the world)
