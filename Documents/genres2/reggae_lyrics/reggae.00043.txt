Ooh, here I come again
Here I come again
Ooh, here I come again
Here I come again
Reggae hit the town, now
Reggae hit the town, now
Full time, right time, nice time
Don't watch that one
Catch this one
Don't watch that one
Catch this one
Ah, how you feelin', man?
Nice, nice
You know I'm gonna spin this disc, man
The man who love to spin them when they're real crisp
That's your hound dog CB
And you know what again, man? Sounds great
The man that put the glee in your knees
That's your old buddy, Soul Shot JB
Well, nice, nice
Ooh, reggae hit the town, now
Reggae hit the town, now
Nice time, right time
Don't watch that one
Catch this one
Don't watch that one
