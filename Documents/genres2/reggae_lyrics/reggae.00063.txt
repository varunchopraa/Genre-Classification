Marcus Garvey's words come to pass
Marcus Garvey's words come to pass
Can't get no food to eat
Can't get no money to spend
Wo-oh-oh can't get no food to eat
Can't get no money to spend
Wo-oh-oh
Come, little one and let me do what I can for you
And you and you alone
Come, little one come, wo-oh-oh
Let me do what I can do for you and you alone, wo-oh-oh
You know the right and do heed might
Shall be spanked with many stripes
Weeping and wailing and moaning
You've got yourself to blame, I tell you
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right, do right, do right, do right, do right
I beg you wo-oh-oh
Tell you to do right
Beg you to do right
Wo-oh-oh
Where is bag of wire, he's nowhere around
He can't be found
First betrayer who gave away Marcus Garvey
Son of Satan, first prophesy
Catch them, Garvey wo-oh-oh
Hold them Marcus, hold them
prophesy fufill wo-oh-oh
Catch them, Garvey, catch them
Hold them Marcus, hold them
wo-oh-oh
Marcus Garvey, Marcus
Words come with a promisse wo-oh-oh
