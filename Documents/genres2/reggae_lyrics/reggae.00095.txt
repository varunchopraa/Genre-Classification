Madness, madness, they call it madness
Madness, madness, they call it madness
It's plain to see, that is what they mean to me
Madness, madness I call it gladness
Madness, madness, they call it madness
But if this is madness
Man, I know I'm filled with gladness
It's gonna be rougher, rough, it's gonna be tougher, tough
And I won't be the one oh, no, no who's gonna suffer
Propaganda ministers
Propaganda ministers
I've got a aim in view
Man, I'm gonna walk all over you
'Cause madness, madness they call it madness
But if this is madness
Man, I know I'm filled with gladness
It's gonna be rougher, rough, it's gonna be tougher, tough
And I won't be the one oh, no, no who's gonna suffer
People you'll see the one who's gonna suffer
And I'll never, never, never be that one who's gonna suffer
