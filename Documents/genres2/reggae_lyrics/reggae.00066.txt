Whoa yeah, whoa yeah, yeah, alright
Sitting here watching fools like themselves when
They should all be thinking of getting to know themselves
While life goes on everyone's got to stand strong
You can't surrender, no no no
Giving your heart and soul to vanity, yeah
Makes your life filled with pain and misery
While life goes on everyone's got to stand strong
You can't surrender, no no no, oh no
Whoa yeah
Got to be good to yourself, yeah, whoa yeah
Whoa yeah, whoa yeah, ah
Sitting here watching fools like themselves when
They should all be thinking of getting to know themselves
While life goes on everyone's got to stand strong
You can't surrender, no no no, whoa
Giving your heart and soul to vanity, yeah
Makes one's life filled with pain and misery
While life goes on everyone's got to stand strong
You can't surrender, no no, oh no
