Gonna pack my whole life in a suitcase
Gonna throw the suitcase in my car
And drive that car to a place
Where no one remember my face
I'm too young to wed
I've just got to run and hide
'Couse here comes the bride
I was looking for a good time not a mortgage
So I'll be following the white line right out of town
No I'm not ready for life
With a real job and pushy young wife
I'm too young to wed
I've just got to run and hide
'Couse here comes the bride
I've got to hold my ground
Turn it around
This time it's all about me
She'll try to hold me down
Push me around
Don't wanna be what she wants me to be
Gonna step in the gas when I see the limousine
Goona pack my whole life in a suitcase
Goona throw the suitcase in my car
And drive that car to a place
Where no one remember my face
I'm too young to wed
I've just got to run and hide
'Couse here comes the bride
I've got to hold my ground
Turn it around
This time it's all about me
She'll try to hold me down
Push me around
Don't wanna be what she wants me to be
Gonna step in the gas when I see the limousine
Here she comes
Gonna drive that car to a place
Where no one remember my face
I'm too young to wed
I've just got to run and hide
'Couse here comes the bride
I'm too young to wed
I'm just got to run and hide
'Couse here comes the bride
Slip out the back
'Couse here comes the limousine
