Skylarking, skylarking
That's what youth do today
Skylarking, skylarking
Before they stand up firm on their feet
Get a likkle work, a likkle work
And earn their bread honestly
Beggin' you a five cent, sir
Beggin' you a ten cent, sir
Cannot help, no, cannot help
So if you all keep on doing what you all are doing
You will end up, up up in jail
