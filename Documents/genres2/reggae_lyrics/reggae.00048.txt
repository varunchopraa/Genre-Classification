Whoo, ooh, yeah
Last night I weren't at home
I just went for a stroll
But when I returned, I saw this note
Underneath my door, stating
You'll never ever see me again
So now our love must end
You'll never ever see me again
My friend 'cause
I'll be taking this train
I'll be taking westbound train
I'll be going to a place where there is happiness
So you'll never ever see me again
I'll be taking westbound train
You'll never ever see me again, my friend
No, you'll never ever see me
Whoa, cherry baby
I've gotta find you baby 'cause
I'll never live in a world like that
You want to make me feel sad
And now I'm in very, very steep position
So that's why this train won't miss me
'Cause I've got to find my cherry baby
You'll never ever see me, no, no
Whoa, cherry baby
I've gotta find you baby
'Cause I'll never live in a world like that
You want to make me feel sad
And now I'm in very, very steep position
So that's why this train won't miss me
'Cause I've got to find my cherry baby
