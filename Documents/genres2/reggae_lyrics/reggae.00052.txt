Man man
Look up at the sky
All the stars man
The stars is beautiful tonight
Look at 'em
Ghetto superstar
That is what you are
Comin' from afar
Reachin' for the stars
Run away with me
To another place
We can rely
On each other, uh-huh
From one corner
To another, uh-huh
Uh, yeah, yo, yo
Some got, hopes and dreams
We got, ways and means
The surpreme dream team
Always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to sellin' raps
Name your theme
My rise to the top
Floatin' on this cream
Who the hell wanna stop me
I hated those who doubt me
A million ReFugees
With unlimited warranties
Black Ceasar
Dating top skeezers
Diplomatic legalese
No time for a Visa
They just begun
I'ma shoot them one by one
Got five sides to me
Somethin' like a Pentagon
Strike with the
Forces of King Solomon
Lettin' bygones be bygones
And so on, and so on
I'ma teach this cat
How to live in the ghetto
Keepin' it retro-spective
From the get go
Lay low, let my mind
Shine like a halo
P-P-Politic with ghetto
Senators on the deelow
Ghetto superstar
That is what you are
Comin' from afar
Reachin' for the stars
Run away with me
To another place
We can rely
On each other, uh-huh
From one corner
To another, uh-huh
One two, and you don't stop, yo
My eyes is sore, bein' a senator
Behind closed doors hittin'
Truth to the seafloor
The rich go North ignore
The tug of war
While the kids are poor
Open new and better drug stores
So I became hardcore
Couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal everything
Change the law
I find myself
Walkin' the streets
Tryin' to find what's really
Goin' on in the streets
Yea, yo, yo, yo
Now every dog got his day
Needless to say
When the chief away that's
When them cats want to play
I told you, mess around
You fools like Cassius Clay
Stretch my heater make
You do a pas de bourree
Kick your balls like Pele
Pick 'em doin' ballet
Peak like Dante
Broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador
Cry yellin', ole
Who the hell wanna save me
From B.K., to Cali
Come on
Ghetto superstar
That is what you are
Comin' from afar
Reachin' for the stars
Run away with me
To another place
We can rely
On each other, uh-huh
From one corner
To another, uh-huh
Yeah, yo, yeah
Just when you thought
It was safe in a common place
Showcase your finest is
Losin' fast in the horse race
Two faced, gettin' defaced
Out like Scarface
Throw your roll money
Let me put on my screwface
Well I'm paranoid
At the things I said
Wonderin' what's the penalty
From day to day, I'm hangin' out
Partyin' with girls
That never die
You see I was
Pickin' on the small fries
My campaign tellin' lies
Was just spreadin' my love
Didn't know my love
Was the one holdin'
The gun and the glove
But it's all good as long
As it's understand
It's all together now
In the hood
Ghetto superstar
That is what you are
Comin' from afar
Reachin' for the stars
Run away with me
To another place
We can rely
On each other, uh-huh
From one corner
To another, uh-huh
Uh-huh uh-huh
Uh-huh uh-huh
Yeah
All Stars
Yeah yeah yeah
Ghetto superstar
That is what you are
Comin' from afar
Reachin' for the stars
Run away with me
To another place
We can rely
On each other, uh-huh
From one corner
To another, uh-huh
Sing it baby
Sing it baby
To another
Yeah, hee, ahh
