Theses are the ten commandments from man
Given to woman
Through the inspiration of I, Prince Buster
One,
Thou shall have no other man but me
Two,
Though shall not encourage no man to make love to you
Neither kiss or caress you
For I am your man, a very jealous man
And is ready to lay low any other man who may intrude on our love
Three,
Remember to kiss and caress me
Honor and obey me, in my every whim and fancy
Seven days a week and twice on Sundays
Because at no time will I ever be tired 0f I-T "it"
Four,
Honor my name, so that every other woman may honor it also
Five,
Thou shall not provoke me to anger
Or my wrath will descend upon you heavily
Commandment Six,
Thou shall not search my pockets at night
Or annoy me with your hearsays
Commandment Seven,
Thou shall not shout my name in the streets
If I am walking with another woman
But wait intelligently until I come home
Then we can both have it out decently
For I am your man, a funny man
And detest a scandal in public places
Commandment Eight,
Thou shall not drink, or smoke
Nor use profane language
For those bad habits I will not stand for
Nine,
Thou shall not commit adultery
For the world will not hold me guilty if I commit murder
Ten,
Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's dress
Nor her shoes, nor her bureau, nor her bed, nor her hat
Nor anything that's hers
Neither shall thou call my attention to anything that may be for sale
In any stores, for I will not give thee anything
But what you actually need for your purpose
These are the ten commandments from man
Given to woman
