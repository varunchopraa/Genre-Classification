Come along yeah and dig my song
Too much wagonist
Too much antagonist
Wolves and leopards are trying to kill
The sheep and the shepherd, yes
Wolves and leopards are trying to kill
The sheep and the shepherd, yeah
Too much informers
Too much talebearers
Too much informers
Too much talebearers
Time to separate the sheep from the wolves
We're at the crossroads
And this is the time of decision
Too much informers
Too much talebearers
Too much informers
Too much talebearers, yeah
Too much watch and peep
It's time the wolves dem leave the sheep
Too much watch and peep
It's time the wolves dem leave the sheep
Wolves and leopards are trying to kill
The sheep and the shepherd
Wolves and leopards are trying to kill
The sheep and the shepherd
Too much informers
Too much talebearers
Wolves and leopards are trying to kill
The sheep and the shepherd
Wolves and leopards are trying to kill
The sheep and the shepherd
Too much watch and peep
It's time the wolves dem leave the sheep
Too much watch and peep
It's time the wolves dem leave the sheep
Lion, yeah
