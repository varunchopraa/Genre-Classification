And now rude boys have a go wail
'Cause them out of jail
Rude boys cannot fail
'Cause them must get bail
Dem a loot, dem a shoot, dem a wail (a shanty town)
Dem a loot, dem a shoot, dem a wail (a shanty town)
Dem rude boys get a probation (a shanty town)
And rude boy bomb up the town (a shanty town)
