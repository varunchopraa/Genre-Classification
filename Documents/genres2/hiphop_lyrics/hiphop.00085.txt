I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
Here's your ticket
Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to Black
Attack so I sack and jack
Then slapped the Mac
Now I'm ready to mic it
(You know I like it) huh
Hear my favoritism roll "Oh"
Never be a brother like me go solo
Laser, anesthesia, maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I'm living, forgiven
What I'm giving up
X on the flex, hit me now
I don't know about later
As for now, I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man, I've had it up to here
Gear I wear got 'em going in fear
Rhetoric said and
Read just a bit ago
Not quitting, though
Signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from getting jerked
Changing some ways
To way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold
Never followed a code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am God knows
Cause it's coming from the heart
What I got better get some
(Get on up) hustler of culture
Snakebitten
Been spit in the face
But the rhymes keep fitting
Respects been giving how's ya living
Now I can't protect a paid off defect
Check the record
And reckon an intentional wreck
Played off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall
Broke the laws
Not my fault that they're falling off
Known as fair square
Throughout my years
So I growl at the living foul
Black to the bone my home is your home
So welcome to the Terrordome
Subordinate terror
Kicking off an era
Cold delivering pain
My 98 was 87 on a record yo
So now I go Bronco
Crucifixion ain't no fiction
So-called chosen frozen
Apology made to whoever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus
I rather sing, bring, think, reminisce
'Bout a brother while I'm in sync
Every brother ain't a brother cause a color
Just as well could be undercover
Backstabbed, grabbed a flag
From the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say I got sold down the river
Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never know or had a clue
Word was Herb, plus hard on the boulevard
Lies, scandalizin', basing
Traits of hate who's celebrating with Satan?
I rope-a-dope the evil with righteous
Bobbing and weaving and let the good get even
C'mon down
But welcome to the Terrordome
Caught in the race against time
The pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes
While I'm bending 'um
Snakes blowing up the lines of design
Trying to blind the science I'm sending 'em
How to fight the power
Cannot run and hide
But it shouldn't be suicide
In a game a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother ain't a brother
Cause a Black hand
Squeezed on Malcolm X the man
The shooting of Huey Newton
From a hand of a Nig who pulled the trig
It's weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First nothing's worse than a mother's pain
Of a son slain in Bensonhurst
Can't wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with the racist faces
Example of one of many cases
The Greek weekend speech I speak
From a lesson learned in Virginia (Beach)
I don't smile in the line of fire
I go wildin'
But it's on bass and drums and even violins
Watcha do gitcha head ready
Instead of getting physically sweaty
When I get mad
I put it down on a pad
Give ya something that cha never had
Controlling
Fear of high rolling
God bless your soul and keep living
Never allowed, kicking it loud
Dropping a bomb
Brain game intellectual Vietnam
Move as a team
Never move alone
But
Welcome to the Terrordome
