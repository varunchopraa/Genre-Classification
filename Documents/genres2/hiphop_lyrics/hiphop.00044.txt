Come on!
Spanish Harlem
Boogie Down Bronx
Manhattan
Back to Staten
Guantanamera (Hey yo I'm standing at the bar with a Cuban cigar)
Guajira, guantanamera (Hey, yo, I think she's eyeing me from afar)
Guantanamera
Guajira, guantanamera
Yo, I wrote this in Haiti, overlooking Cuba
I asked her what's her name, she said, 'Guantanamera'
Remind me of an old latin song, my uncle used to play
On his old forty-five when he used to be alive
She went from a young girl, to a grown woman like a Virgin
So she sex with no average man
Peep the figure, move like a caterpillar
Fly like a butterfly, let your soul feel her glide
Pac Woman better yet Space Invader
If your name was Chun-Li, we'd be playin' Street Fighter
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for your kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Guantanamera (Hey yo I'm standing at the bar with a Cuban cigar)
Guajira, guantanamera (Hey, yo, I think she's eyeing me from afar)
Guantanamera
Guajira, guantanamera
Soy una mujer sincera (Do you speak English?)
De donde crece la palma (Can I buy you a drink?)
Soy una mujer, sincera
De donde crece la palma (You killin' me)
Y antes de morir, yo quiero
Cantar mis versos del alma (Te quiero mamá, te quiero)
Guantanamera (Hey yo I'm standing at the bar with a Cuban cigar)
Guajira, guantanamera (Hey, yo, John Forte, I think she's eyeing me from afar)
Guantanamera
Guajira, guantanamera
Yo, she was a rose in Spanish Harlem, mamacita beg your pardon?
Make stakes at a faster rate than she fornicates
Pure traits of genius, goddess of Black Venus
Crab niggaz angry cause they can't get between us
To no selección, smooth complexión
The lexicon of Lexington, parents came from Cuba
Part Mexican, pure sweet, dimes fell to her feet
She like Movado, and shook her hips like Delgado
And broke niggaz down from the grounds to Apollo
And then some, she took her act sent it to dim sum
And waited patiently while the businessmen come
Call late on purpose, got even politicians nervous
And made plans to infiltrate the street secret service
This gentle flower, fertility was her power
Sweet persona, Venus Flytrap primadonna
Qué será, qué será, she turned dinero to dinera
Guantanamera (Hey yo I'm standing at the bar with a Cuban cigar)
Guajira, guantanamera (Hey, yo, I think she's eyeing me from afar)
Guantanamera
Guajira, guantanamera
