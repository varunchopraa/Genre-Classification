Man, don't you worry 'bout a thing
'Bout your daughter, nope she's not my type
But suppose' she said she loved me
Are you afraid of the mix of Black and White?
We're livin' in a land where the law say
Mixing of race makes the blood impure
She's a woman I'm a man
Look on your face, I see ya can't stand it
Man you need to calm down, don't get mad
I don't need your sista
But suppose' she said she loved me
Would you still love her or would you dismiss her
What is pure? Who is pure?
Is it European? I ain't sure
If the whole world was to come through peace and love
Then what would we be made of?
Excuse us for the news
You might not be amused
But did you know white comes from Black
No need to be confused
Excuse us for the news
I question those accused
Why is this fear of Black from White
Influence who you choose?
Man, I don't want your wife
Stop screamin', it's not the end of your life
(But suppose' she said she loved me)
What's wrong with some color in your family tree?
I don't know, hey, I'm just a rhyme sayer
Skins protected 'gainst the ozone layers
Breakdown 2001
Might be best to be Black or just Brown countdown
I've been wonderin' why
People livin' in fear
Of my shade
(Or my high-top fade)
I'm not the one that's runnin'
But they got me one the run
Treat me like I have a gun
All I got is genes and chromosomes
Consider me Black to the bone
All I want is peace and love on this planet
(Ain't how that God planned it?)
Excuse us for the news
You might not be amused
But did you know white comes from Black
No need to be confused
Excuse us for the news
I question those accused
Why is this fear of Black from White
Influence who you choose?
