Body movin', body movin'
A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing
Body movin', body movin'
We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin'
Body movin', body movin'
A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing
Body movin', body movin'
We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin'
Now, let me get some action from the back section
We need body rockin' not perfection
Let your back bone flip but don't slip a disc
And let your spine unwind, just take a risk
I wanna' do the freak until the break of dawn
Tell me party people is that so wrong
The ship is docking, interlockin'
And up-rockin', electro-shocking
We're getting down, computer action
Do the robotic satisfaction
Now all of y'all, ah get off the wall
Have a ball and get involved with
Body movin', body movin'
A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing
Body movin', body movin'
We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin'
Flame on, I'm gone
I'm so sweet like a nice bon bon
Came out rapping when I was born
Mom said rock it 'til the break of dawn
Puttin' bodies in motion cause I got the notion
Like Roy Cormier with the coconut lotion
The sound of the music makin' you insane
You can't explain to people this type of mind frame
Like a bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape
I'm fine like wine when I start to rap
We need body rockin', not perfection
Let me get some action from the back section
Body movin', body movin'
A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing
Body movin', body movin'
We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin'
Mike D, with the master plan
I said, ooh my my and thank you, ma'am
And when I grab the mic you scream, 'ooh, goddamn'
The crème de la crème is who I am
MCA, where have you been
Packed like sardines in the tin
So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
'Cause when it comes to quarries I'm known to swim
And Adrock, light up the place
And if you pull my card, you pull the ace
And if you ask me turn up the bass
And if you play defender
I could be your hyperspace, so
Body movin', body movin'
A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing
Body movin', body movin'
We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin'
