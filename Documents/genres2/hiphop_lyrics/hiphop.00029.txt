What would you do, to get to me?
What would you say, to have your way?
Would you give it up or try again?
If I hesitate to let you in?
Now would you be yourself, or play a role?
Tell all the boys, or keep it low?
If I say no, would you turn away,
Or play me off or would you stay?
Oh
If at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed),
Dust yourself off, and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed),
Dust yourself off, and try again
You can dust it off and try again, dust yourself off and try again, try again
I'm into you, you into me? But I can't let it go, so easily.
Not 'till I see, where this could be, could be eternally, or just week.
You know our chemistry, it's off the chain.
It's perfect now, but will it change?
This ain't a yes, this ain't a no.
Just do your thang, and we'll see how it goes.
Ooooh
If at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed),
Dust yourself off, and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed),
Dust yourself off, and try again
You can dust it off and try again, dust yourself off and try again, try again
See you don't wanna throw it all away.
I might be shy on the first day,
But what about the next day? (huh, huh, huh, huh)
See you don't wanna throw it all away.
I might be buggin' on the first day,
But what about the next day? (huh, huh, huh, huh)
If at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed),
Dust yourself off, and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
