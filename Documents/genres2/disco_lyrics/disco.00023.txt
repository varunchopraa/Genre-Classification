I don't care if you're rich or poor
Oh baby I don't care if you live next door
And I don't care of your college grades
Oh baby I don't care how much bet you made

And I don't care who came here for me
Just really know I'm in love
Gotta have a love that strong
Loving you is important to me
So don't go wasting time, just say you're mine

Won't you be my playboy
I wanna be your playtoy too
(Won't you be my) Won't you be my playboy
I only wanna be with you
I need a lot of warm affection
Just to keep me satisfied
Can't help feeling a strong attraction
Hit me with your love reaction
Won't you be my playboy
I wanna be your playtoy too

I don't care for outrageous things
Oh baby, I don't need things like diamond rings
I only need love that serious
So baby come right here I got plans for us

And all the girls have got your number
I love you so just say no
I need your love tonight
Don't you satisfy their hunger
And I mean it when I say keep far away

Won't you be my playboy
I wanna be your playtoy too
(Won't you be my) Won't you be my playboy
I only wanna be with you
I need a lot of warm affection
Just to keep me satisfied
Can't help feeling a strong attraction
Hit me with your love reaction
Won't you be my playboy
I wanna be your playtoy too

I want a playboy. Do you wanna?
Do, do you wanna make me very happy?

I don't need no limousine
See, I feel at home in my baggy jeans
And I don't need those things you buy
Baby all I want is an honest guy
And I don't need no fancy yacht
I don't care how much you got
All I want is a boy like you - maybe two!

Won't you be my playboy
I wanna be your playtoy too
(Won't you be my) Won't you be my playboy
I only wanna be with you

Won't you be my playboy
I wanna be your playtoy too
Won't you be my playboy
I only wanna be with you

(Won't you be my)
Won't you be my playboy

Won't you be my playboy
I wanna be your playtoy too
Won't you be my playboy
I only wanna be with you
