Could you turn me on
Don't matter what did you though
Can I ever get enough

Jealousy feels brain
Man you're going insane
I don't wanna talk about it

I want, one try
A tiger got a feeling tonight
I need some tease
Someone who's gonna feel up a slice

Sex, forbidden, illegal, is something that's gonna take my breath away
Sex, too hours I wanted he's comming and I suppouse to be in love

I feel so high
I want to investing time all the night
What's wrong what's right?
I need another lover tonight

My body is getting tense
Should I cry this trance
I can make you mine tonight

My mind is getting bright
Now I see the light
I don't wanna start to fight

I can't deny
A tiger got a feeling tonight
What's wrong what right?
I need another lover tonight

Sex, forbidden, illegal, is something that's gonna take my breath away
Sex, too hours I wanted he's comming and I suppouse to be in love

I feel so high
I want to investing time all the night
What's wrong what's right?
I need another lover tonight

Sex, forbidden, illegal, is something that's gonna take my breath away
Sex, too hours I wanted he's comming and I suppouse to be in love
