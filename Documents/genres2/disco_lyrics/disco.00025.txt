High energy, your love is lifting me
Oh, high energy
Your love is lifing me
Lifting me high
It was only last week that we first met
When I was walking down the street
You came up from behind me and I knew
That our eyes were gonna meet
That's when I fell into your arms
Imagine my surprise
I thought this only happened in fairy tales
Love hit me right between the eyes
Oh yeah
High energy, your love is lifting me
Whoa-ooh high energy, yeah
Your love is lifting me
Lifting me high
When you call me on the phone you make my spirits rise
I'm glad the others didn't last
It's a blessing in disguise
Every time you're touching me
It gives me such a thrill
When I look deep into your eyes
My heart just can't keep still, oh no
High energy, your love is lifting me
Whoa-ooh high energy, yeah
Your love is lifting me
Lifting me high
All the gold that's in Fort Knox couldn't buy this happiness
With your love I don't need money
I don't need success
I became a victim of a sudden love attack, yeah
It happened in a blink of an eye
And there's no holding back, oh
High energy, yeah, your love is lifting me
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa-ooh high energy, ooh yeah
Your love is lifting me
Lifting me high (energy)
(Your love is lifting me
High energy)
