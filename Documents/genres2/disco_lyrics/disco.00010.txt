Oh, yeah
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an encore)
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
You deserve an encore (deserves an encore)
Going to a show tonight
After working hard 9 to 5
Not talking 'bout a movie, no
Or a Broadway play, this show is live
And I know it's you (oh) I want to see (oh) tonight
(Wanna see you tonight)
I'll buy my ticket (oh) at the door if it's (Hey) alright
(So your show can make me feel good again)
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an encore)
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
You deserve an encore (deserves an encore)
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an encore)
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
You deserve an encore (deserves an encore)
I can give you rave reviews
'Cause you sold out my heart with love
And every time that I'm with you
Boy, you take control, I'm your captive audience
And I know it's you I want to see (oh) tonight
(Wanna see you tonight)
I'll buy my ticket (oh, oh) at the door if it's (Hey) alright
(If your performance make me feel good again)
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an encore)
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
You deserve an encore (deserves an encore)
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an encore)
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
You deserve an encore (Deserves an encore)
Can't get enough, ooh
Of your gentle lovin' touch
I can't get enough
So intense, it drives me nuts
Makes me want to break it down now
Yeah
Mmm
Feels so good, feels so good
It deserves an encore
Oh, ah
Oh, ah
Oh, ah
Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah
Oh, ah (oh, yeah)
Deserves an encore
Bring it
Bring it
Bring it up
Bring it up
Bring it up
Oh, I'm talkin' 'bout my baby
Oh
Woo
Alright
Yeah
I've got to go
