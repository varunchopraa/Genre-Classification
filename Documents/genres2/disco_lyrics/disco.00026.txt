Do you wanna dance
I feel like... Feel like doing something nasty tonight
Es una noche para el amor
Vamos a bailar
Bailar
When I look into your eyes
I feel the magic deep inside
Oh, oh, oh, oh
When I
I feel like I
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Just lie and tell me that you love me baby
Give us one more chance
(Give us one more chance)
Feel my body burning, everybody
Let
Everybody do the salsa
To the rhythm of the rumba
Shake your hips to the samba
Everybody do the salsa
To the rhythm of a real hot summer night
Shake your body to the samba
Siente el ritmo de salsa, salsa
When I
My body feels you want me more
Oh, oh, oh, oh
When the heat is rising high
Then you know it
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I wet my lips and gently kiss your neck
Feel it deep inside
Feel the rhythm of the night oh baby
Dance right through the night
Everybody do the salsa
To the rhythm of the rumba
Shake your hips to the samba
Everybody do the salsa
To the rhythm of a real hot summer night
Shake your body to the samba
Oh dance the night away, baby
Dance the night away, dance the night away
Dance the night away, baby dance the night away
Dance the night away, dance the night away
Feel the salsa
Let
let
Everybody do the salsa
Shake your hips to the samba
Everybody do the salsa
Shake your body to the samba
Vamos a bailar, bailar
(Dance the night away, dance the night away)
Siente el ritmo de salsa
(Oh, dance the night away)
Mi amor, vamos a bailar! Chicos e chicas!
Everybody do the salsa
Shake your hips to the samba
Everybody do the salsa
Shake your body to the samba
