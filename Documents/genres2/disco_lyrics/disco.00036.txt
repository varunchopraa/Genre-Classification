I got the price for a ford
Looking for a rolls royce
They wanna keep me down
I can't afford a house
I want something better than all the rest
All my life I've reaching for the best
Reaching for lifes happiness
Reaching for the very very best
Ooh yeah
I want a pocket full of money
But I don't have a pocket
Gotta be a star
I just don't have anything
I got a feeling more than the rest
All my life I've been reaching for the best
Reaching for lifes happiness
Reaching for the very very best
Ooh yeah
I'm reaching for the very best
Reaching for the very very best of life
I dream of running away
With a friend
Want a whole lot of money
Wanna be somebody
