I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, I
I never can say goodbye
Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right to the core
It says, turn around, you fool
You know you love him more and more
Tell me why is it so?
Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye, boy
Ooh, ooh, baby
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, no no no
Ooh, oh I never can say goodbye boy
Ooh baby
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, ooh
I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, I
I never can say goodbye
I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
There's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's that same old dizzy hangup
I can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so?
I don't wanna let you go, hey
I never can say goodbye boy
Ooh ooh baby
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, no no no
Ooh, ooh I never can say goodbye boy
Ooh ooh
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, no no no, hey
I never can say goodbye boy
Ooh ooh baby
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, no no no
Ooh, ooh I never can say goodbye boy
Ooh ooh baby
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, no no no, hey
Hey, I never can say goodbye boy
Ooh ooh baby
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, no no no
