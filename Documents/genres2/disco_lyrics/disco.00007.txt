Need I say to you, he's a Montague
Turn your eyes away, speak no more of this young villain
He's our only foe, a Capulet should know
Turn your eyes away, speak no more of this young villain
But oh I love him, Oh how I love him
I know I love him more than words more than words
Could ever say
But oh I love him, Oh how I love him
I know I love him more than words more than words
Could ever say
What can you expect? She's a Capulet
Turn your eyes away, speak no more of this young woman
She's our only foe, a Montague should know
Turn your eyes away, speak no more of this young woman
But oh I love her, Oh how I love her
I know I love her more than words more than words
Could ever say
But oh I love her, Oh how I love her
I know I love her more than words more than words
Could ever say
Sweet Montague I love you, a thousand times I love you
Oh I couldn't live my life without you
Oh Romeo I love you
I'll wait until tomorrow, parting is such sweet sorrow
Oh Romeo I love you
Oh I couldn't live my life without you
Sweet Capulet I love you, a thousand times I love you
Oh I couldn't live my life without you
Oh Juliet I love you
Please wait until tomorrow, our love will end all sorrow
Oh Juliet I love you
Oh I couldn't live my life without you
