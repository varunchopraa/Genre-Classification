It's morning, I open my eyes
And everything's still the same
I turn to the guy who stayed last night
And ask him, "What's your name?"
It seems to happen more and more
I love those men one and all
Each new one I meet makes my heart beat fast
When I see them so strong and tall
So many men, so little time
How can I lose?
So many men, so little time
How can I choose?
They tell me I'm up to no good
I should just settle down
But I don't wanna stay with just one man
I wanna sell for what's around
Feels like heaven every night
Being here with someone new
A physical thrill, a beautiful smile
And wonderful muscles, too
So many men, so little time
How can I lose?
So many men, so little time
How can I choose?
So really, who cares about love?
Who wants to feel taken away?
For fifty-two weeks of every year
There's a new man every day
It's too hard a choice to make up my mind
So many men can turn on my light
Don't want true love, don't want friends
Just give me the bodies tonight
So many men, so little time
How can I lose?
So many men, so little time
How can I choose?
So really, who cares about love?
Who wants to feel taken away?
For fifty-two weeks of every year
There's a new man every day
It's too hard a choice to make up my mind
So many men can turn on my light
Don't want true love, don't want friends
Just give me the bodies tonight
So many men, so little time
How can I lose?
So many men, so little time
How can I choose?
