Satisfaction guaranteed or take your love back
I'll give you something good, yes I will
Give you something good, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
You don't have to believe me when I tell you

But I'm the one that you always needed
I tell ya what, I'll make you a bet
I'll give you love you will never forget, no, no
Satisfaction guaranteed
