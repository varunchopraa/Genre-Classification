Yeah, ooo, ooo-oh
Look at her
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
Her body measurements
Are perfect in every dimension
She's got a figure
That's sho 'nuff payin' attention
She's poetry in motion
Beautiful sight to see
I get so excited
Viewing her anatomy
She's built (She's built, she's stacked)
Oh she's stacked (All the curves that men like)
Got all the curves men like
She's built (She's built, she's stacked)
Oh she's stacked (All the curves men like)
Got all the curves that men like
Look at her!
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
Hey!
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
Looks like
She's poured into the gold, she bad
An essence of beauty
Ooo, such lovely hair
She's foxy, classy
Oh, sexy sassy
She's heavenly
A treat for the eye to see
Ooo wee!
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
Hey!
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
Woo, hoo
Na, na, na, na
[Repeat x 2]
She's built, she's stacked
All the curves that men like
Her body measurements
Are perfect in every dimension
She's got a figure
That's sho 'nuff payin' attention
She's poetry in motion
Beautiful sight to see
I get so excited
Viewing her anatomy
Look at her!
