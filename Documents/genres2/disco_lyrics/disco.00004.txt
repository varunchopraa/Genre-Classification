Looking out on the world, all I see
Shadows of the girl who meant so much to me
How I tried, to turn my back on that woman
Hey! Hey!
Run back
I'm missing you baby
I'm sad
You really did hurt me
Run back
Make it up baby while we still got time
Every night I lie awake, I'm on the phone
Forget the fight, wrong or right, I want you home
In my dreams all I see is that woman
Hey! Hey!
Run back
I'm missing you baby
I'm sad
But it really did hurt me
Run back
And make it up baby, while we still got time
I'm talkin'!
Run back
Here I'm waiting
I'm sad
But I can't wait forever
Don't try
To take me for granted
Come and change your mind
While we still got time
Run back
I'mâ€¦
