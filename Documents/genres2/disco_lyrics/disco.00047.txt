It's raining, it's pouring
My lovelife is boring me to tears, after all these years
No sunshine, no moonlight, no stardust, no sign of romance
We don't stand a chance
I've always dreamed I found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man
Our love, our love
Raining (raining)
Pouring (pouring)
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waste another tear
Ah, yeah
If you've had enough, don't put up with his stuff, don't you do it
If you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill, you can do it
Tell him to just get out
Nothing left to talk about
Pack his raincoat show him out
Just look him in the eye and simply shout
Enough is enough (is enough)
I can't go on, I can't go on no more, no
Enough is enough (is enough)
I want him out, I want him out that door now
I've always dreamed I found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man
Our love (I had no choice from the start)
Our love
Our love (I've gotta listen to my heart)
Our love (Tearing us apart)
Our love, ooh
Enough is enough (is enough)
I can't go on, I can't go on no more, no
Enough is enough (is enough)
I want him out, I want him out that door now
Goodbye mister, goodbye, goodbye mister
Goodbye sugar
No more tears
No more tears
No more tears
I've had it, we've had it, you've had it, he's had it
No more tears
Is enough, is enough, is enough, is enough, is enough, is enough, is enough
