...A little thing I'm going to do called "I'm bad like Jesse James:"

I'm bad, I'm bad, like Jesse James, uh-uh
I had a friend one time
'least I thought I did
He come to me, said, Johnny
I said what, man?
I want dough
I said, yeah
I'd taken the cat in
Get him a place to stay
And I found out
He goin' around town
Telling everybody that he
He got my wife, heh
And I gets man
I goes to the cat
Like a good guy should
I said look man
I'm gonna warn you
Just one time
Next time I warn you
I'mma use my gun

'Cause I'm mad, I'm bad, like Jesse James

I'm so mad, I'm so mad!
I'm gonna run you this morning
I got three boys
Do my dirty work
Now you don't see me
On the big balls
I do the [pay, now?]
After they take care of you
In their own way
They may shoot you
They may cut you
They may drown you
I just don't know
I don't care!
As long as they take care of you
In their own way

I'm so mad, I'm bad, this mornin', like Jesse James
They're gonna take you right down
By the riverside
Now four is goin' down
And only three coming back
You read between the lines
What's gonna happen to you

'Cause I'm mad, I'm bad, like Jesse James
They gonna tie your hands
They gonna tie your feet
They gonna gag your throat
Where you can't holla none
And crying won't help you none
They gonna send you in the water
Got the bubbles coming up
Ooo! (grrr, rrr!)

Aww yea! I'm so mad!
