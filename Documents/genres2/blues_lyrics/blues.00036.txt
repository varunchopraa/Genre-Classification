Where were you when the train left town
I was standing on the corner, my head hanging down
I be crying hey, train carried my girl away
I be crying hey, that train carried my girl away from town
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Show me the woman that I can trust
I be crying hey, train carried my girl away
I be crying hey, that train carried my girl away from town
I wish to the lord that train would wreck
Kill the engineer and break that fireman's neck
I wish to the lord that train would turn around
Bring my girl back to this here town
I be crying hey, train carried my girl away
I be crying hey, that train carried my girl away from town
Smoke-cloud rising, heading for the west
There goes the baby that I love the best
Smoke-cloud falling down from the sky
Oh my girl won't you tell me why
Train carried my girl away from town
Where were you when the train left town?
