It's all right
It's all right, yeah
It's all right
It's all right, yeah
It ran all night
I got a gal, she's a country gal
When it comes down to lovin' me
She knows what to do
You love me, honey
In the mornin'
Love me late at night
When it comes to lovin' me, yeah
She's mine, all mine
My hot tamale baby
Hot tamale baby
Hot tamale baby
I got a gal, she's a country gal
When it comes down to lovin' me
She is mine, all mine
