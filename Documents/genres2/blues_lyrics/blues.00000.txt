One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer
Well, my baby, she gone, gone tonight
I ain't seen the girl since night before last
I wanna get drunk, get off of my mind
One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer
And I sit there
Get stoned
Mellow
Stoned, feelin' good
Real mellow
Dreamin'
After a while, I looked down the bar
At the bartender
I said, "Hey, what do you want?"
One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer
Well, my baby, she gone, gone tonight
I ain't seen the baby since night before last
I wanna get drunk, get off of my mind
One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer
Ah-ha, yeah, uh-m
I'm gonna sit there, I was tastin'
Sippin', gettin' rolling
And gettin' a little dizzy
Couldn't hardly see
The bartender
Couldn't hardly sip
On the bar stool
I was rockin' and I was dizzy
And after a while, I looked on the wall
At the old clock
By that time eleven o'clock
Gettin' a little late
And I looked down the bar
At the bartender
I said, "Hey, what do you want?"
One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer
Well, my baby, she gone, gone tonight
I ain't seen my baby since night before last
I wanna get drunk, get off of my mind
One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer
Ah-ha, yeah, yes, sir
And I sit there
At the bar
Uh-m, drinkin'
And after a while, I looked down the bar
At the bartender
Then after I looked down the bar, I looked on the wall
At the old clock
By that time, when the last call for alcohol
Was a quarter to two
Then I looked down the bar
At the bartender
I said, "Hey, what do you want?"
One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer
