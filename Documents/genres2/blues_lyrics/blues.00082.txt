Got to find me a way
To take me back to yesterday
How can I ever hope to forget you?
Won't you show me a place
Where I can hide my lonely face?
I know you're going to break my heart if I let you
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Like a moth to a flame,
Like a song without a name,
I've never been the same since I met you
Like a bird on the wing,
I've got a brand new song to sing,
I can't keep from singing about you
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
I'm beginning to see
What a fool you've made of me
I might have to break the law when I find you
Stop running away;
I've got a better game to play,
You know I can't go on living without you
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
Why does love got to be so sad?
