Katy's down by the cellar door
Calls for me to go
Back down to the clover
Singing soft and low
Singing soft and low

My little one's mother is
Holding him and crying
She hears Katy call my name
And I can see her dying

Katy says she loves me
I used to feel the same
Walking by the old boneyard
Calling out my name

Hand in hand we laid the deed
And evil we have done
Evil I will do no more
To a mother and her son

Katy Katy stay away from me
I could never quit you, no
You gotta let me be
Sharpened up my razor, picked a piece of ground
One of these dark and moonless nights
Be the last around

My lover turns to walk away
And I follow close behind
Trouble in my pocket
Sorrow in my mind and

Hand in hand we laid the deed
And evil we have done
Evil I will do no more
To a mother and her son

Katy Katy stay away from me
I could never quit you, no
You gotta let me be
Sharpened up my razor, picked a piece of ground
One of these dark and moonless nights
Be the last around

Dark is finally coming on and
Silence in the woods
Would a man do over if the lord said that he could

God it's too late now the night has come
Trouble them no more
The cold steel blade across my neck
Suffering will be over

Katy Katy stay away from me
I could never quit you, no
You gotta let me be
Sharpened up my razor, picked a piece of ground
One of these dark and moonless nights
Will be the last around
