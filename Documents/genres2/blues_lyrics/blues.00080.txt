I can't shut out and shut up
Thinking back on what we had
Want to give in, want to give up
Despair washes over you
Where do you go, what will you do?
Your mind is racing in a million directions all at once
Where will you turn you're not in this all alone
Just look around, and you'll see
The answers right before your eyes
I'm here for you and you for me
It's hard to open up, just try and you'll see
True friends will always be there
Thinking back on what we shared
All those times we had
All those times good and bad
Our growing friendship has formed a bond never endin'
You were there through it all
Now it's my turn you're not in this all alone
Just look around, and you'll see
The answers right before your eyes
I'm here for you and you for me
It's hard to open up, just try and you'll see
True friends will always be there
There's no doubt, good lookin' out
When life's not fair, true friends will always be there
