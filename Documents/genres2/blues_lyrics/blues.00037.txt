Piece by lonely piece the mountainside tumbles away
Back down to the river bottom lined with pocket worry stones
A hundred years in hand worn smooth by long grandmother nights
Sitting by the rocking chair waiting for the world
Oh, if I could roll back all the years and talk to my daddy's dad
About all the fears I'm leaving in that maybe he had had
I might get some light to shine down this dusty old dry well
Hear the bucket hit the bottom and the rope come rolling by
When three hundred years has been the time from whence it came
Why hadn't someone yet figured out to lower down the gun
And shoot out the middle of this clawing, staring eye?
Hear the bucket hit the bottom and the rope come rolling by
Sitting by that old rocking chair waiting for the world
