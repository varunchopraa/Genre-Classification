My baby left me this morning
People just around four o'clock
My baby left me this morning
People just around four o'clock
She left me dreamin' dreamin'
People then I woke up crying

Me and my baby don't get along so well
We don't do a doggone thing but fuss and fight all
Most all the time, she left me to dream
People dream most all the time

Ever since my baby left me
I don't do a doggone thing but dream
Yes my nightmares are killing me now

You know I lay down dreamin'
People God knows that I wake up crying

Yes since my baby's been gone
People I just can't eat a bite
I'm gonna get up in the morning
Going down that lonesome road
I don't find my baby
People I won't be back no more
