Sometime I live the country
Sometime I live in town
Sometime I have a grave notion
To jump into the river and drown
Quit your ramblin' quit your gamblin'
Quit staying out late at night
Stay at home with your wife and your family
And sit back by the fireside light.
Irene goodnight
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene goodnight Irene
I will see you in my dreams
Asked your mother for you
But she said you were too young
They said I would never see your face
Well I wish I was never born
Goodnight Irene goodnight
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene goodnight Irene
I will see you .
I love Irene god knows I do
I'm gonna love her till the sea run dry
If I can't have Irene with me tonight
I might take morphine and die
Yeah I might take morphine and die.
Irene goodnight Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
I will see you in my dreams
I will see you in my dreams.
