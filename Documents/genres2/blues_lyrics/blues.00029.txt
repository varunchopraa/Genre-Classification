Well met, well met said an old true love
Well met, well met said he
I've just returned from the salt salt sea
And it's all for the love of thee

Come in, come in my old true love
And have a seat with me
It's been three fourths of a long long year
Since together we have been

No I can't come in, I can't sit down
For I have but a moment's time
They say you are married to a house carpenter
And your heart will never be mine

Yet I could have married a king's daughter dear
And I'm sure she'd have married me
But I've forsaken her crowns of gold
And it's all for the love of thee

Will you forsaken your house carpenter
And go along with me
I'll take you where the grass grows green
On the banks of the deep blue sea

She picked up her little babe
And kisses gave it three
Say's stay right here my darling little babe
And keep your papa company

Hadn't been on the ship but about two weeks
I'm sure it was not three
'til his true love began to weep and moan
And she weeped most bitterly

Says are you weeping for my silver or my gold
Are you weeping for my silver or my store
Are you weeping for your house carpenter
Whose face you'll never see no more

I'm not weeping for your silver or your gold
No I'm not weeping for your store
I am weeping for my darling little babe
Whose face I'll never see no more

They hadn't been on the ship but about three weeks
I'm sure it was not four
'til they sprung a leak in the bottom of the ship
Sunk and never rise no more
