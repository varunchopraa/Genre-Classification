One cold summer night sally slipped away
Door left open wide not a word to say
Hard luck took its toll I can't blame her none
Not today might be here tomorrow

She knew better fare when a girl at home
Hope for a settled life, not this world to roam
Let my prayer be heard and guide me on her way
Not today might be here tomorrow

Been three years and change since I held her near
Up and down these roads I've looked everywhere
And not once have I seen the color of her hair
Not today might be here tomorrow

I'll be a hobo's son surely all my days
Whittle off the hours with a memory for my blade
And carve the hand of sally dear hoping her to find
Not today might be here tomorrow
