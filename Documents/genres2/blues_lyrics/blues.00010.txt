Oh little girl, you look good to me
Hey little girl, you look good to me
I'm just a lonely boy baby, lookin' for someone to love

I went to San Antone, California too
When I got there baby, I feel a lonely boy
I didn't find nobody baby, even talk to me
That's why I'm asking you baby
Please be nice to me
'Cause I'm a lonely boy baby
Looking for someone to love

I walked into a tavern, had myself a seat
Everybody was so gay, having fun but me
When I sat down baby and looked into your face
The first thing I said little girl, you was the one for me
I said ohh, oh baby, I got eyes for you
