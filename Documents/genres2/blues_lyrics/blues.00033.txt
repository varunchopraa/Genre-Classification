Will I shed one more tear for my broken family
And have a glass of whiskey with another friend
That has nowhere to be
Get my feet on the road they feel much better there
Gonna stop trying some day some year
I meant it when I told her I loved her and I did
And I meant when I said goodbye
Grabbed my suitcase and my kid
We'll find another place to call home for a while
Oh I get to itching I don't know why
Wandering away
The grey is coming the wrinkles aren't far behind
More nights than not I think this is the one where I lose my mind
Maybe I can get it right this time
Maybe I can stay up most of tonight
Cause I don't want to see her come at me again reaching for my neck
Wandering away
All these broken promises in a shoebox full of bones
Lie behind the crows feet eyes of anyone
Better when they roam
Whatever happens then falls under the wheel
Dancing to a fiddle tune with the devil on my heel
Wandering away
My knees are wobbly my back keeps going out
Try to sing like a bird but all I can do is mumble and shout and moan
Wake up to another damn day
Wish I was magic I'd make it go away
Last night in a dream I saw her again I tried to scream but couldn't
Wandering away
