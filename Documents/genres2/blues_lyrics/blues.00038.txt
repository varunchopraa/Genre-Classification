Many a time I thought I had fallen down
Away by the wayside away from grace
My heart torn asunder
My legs buckle under me
I have one promise and I have one prayer
Only believe
Thou gonna be saved
All I can offer is one wayward sinner
Confused and surrounded by wavering faith
Let me go quiet
That I may listen
Understand better the weight of the cross
Only believe
Thou gonna be saved
Hearken the voice here
That calls in the morning
Kingdoms and mercies and life for all time
Many a time I thought I had fallen down
Away by the wayside
My heart fallen
My legs buckle under me
I have one promise and I have one prayer
Only believe
Thou gonna be saved
Hearken the voice here
That calls in the morning
Kingdoms and mercies and life for all time
I know you hear my prayer in the morning
I'm not so sure the answer you gave
Should I continue the step that I have taken
And embrace the life that begins away
Only believe
Thou gonna be saved
