I get so lonely
When I dream about you
(Dream)
Can't do without you
(That?s why)
That's why I dream about you
If I could only put my
(Arms)
Arms around you
(Life)
Life would be so fair
We two could
Hug and kiss and
(Never)
Never tire
I'm on fire
(You are)
You are my one desire
I get so lonely when I
(Dream)
Dream about you
(Why)
Why can't you be there?
Tossing and turning in my slumber
(Oh, baby)
Holding you it seems
I'd give you kisses without number
But only in my dreams
I get so lonely
When I dream about you
(Dream)
Can't do without you
(That?s why)
That's why I dream about you
If I could only put my
(Arms)
Arms around you
(Life)
Life would be so fair
Tossing and turning in my slumber
(Oh, baby)
Holding you it seems
I'd give you kisses without number
But only in my dreams
I get so lonely
When I dream about you
(Dream)
Can't do without you
(That?s why)
That's why I dream about you
If I could only put my
(Arms)
Arms around you
(Life)
Life would be so fair
Life would be so fair
(Oh, baby life)
Life would be so fair
(Oh, baby life)
Life would be so fair
