You told me once that you were mine alone forever
And I was yours till the end of eternity
But all those vows are broken now and we will never be the same except in memory
Remember me when the candle lights're gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long long day
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me
A brighter face may take my place when we're apart dear
Another love with a heart more bold than free
But in the end fair weather friends may break your heart dear
If they do sweetheart remember me
Remember me when the candle
Just to know you still remember me
