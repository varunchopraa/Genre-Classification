I'm holdin' onto you
When I close my eyes
You're still in my arms
And we never said goodbye
And it's all that I can do
To go on with my life
But that's supposed to be the reason
Why I'm here tonight
In a downtown restaurant with a friend of a friend
She sure likes to talk and I ain't heard a single word she's said
Oh, but every now and then I nod
And I pretend to pay attention
And I say things like, ?Uh huh?
And, 'Yeah, you're right', and, 'Are you kiddin'?'
And I laugh when it seems
Like the right thing to do
It's hard to hold a conversation
Holdin' on to you
I'd give anything
Just to hear your voice
Or see you look at me and smile
Oh but what I miss the most
Is holdin' onto you
'Cause here I am tonight
Staring at a woman
Who's the last thing on my mind
Oh, but every now and then I nod
And I pretend to pay attention
And I say things like, ?Uh huh?
And, 'Yeah, you're right', and, 'Are you kiddin''
And I laugh when it seems
Like the right thing to do
It's hard to hold a conversation
It's hard to hold a conversation
Holdin' on to you
When I close my eyes
You're still in my arms
And we never said goodbye
