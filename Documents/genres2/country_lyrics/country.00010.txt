I can't stop loving you so I've made up my mind
To live in memories of old lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterdayThose happy hours that we once knew
Though long ago still make me blue
They say that time heels a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apartI can't stop loving you...
(I can't stop loving you)
