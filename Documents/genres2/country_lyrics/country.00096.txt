True in this modern world, when two lovers get together
Chances of 'em ever makin' it to forever
Couldn't be better than two in a million hearts.
Girl, this ain't just another run-of-the-mill emotion.
What I'm feelin' is the definition of devotion.
My love for you is true.
True, like the sun comin' up each mornin'.
Bright as the light in a baby's smile.
Sure as the mountain river windin'.
Right as the rain fallin' from the sky.
Girl, my love for you
Is true.
True, not another minute on this earth can be borrowed,
There's no way to know when I'll live my last tomorrow.
But every day I get, I'll share with you.
This feelin' just keeps gettin' stronger as the time goes by.
It's written on my face, you can see it in my eye.
My love for you is true.
True, like the sun comin' up each mornin'.
Bright as the light in a baby's smile.
Sure as the mountain river windin'.
Right as the rain fallin' from the sky.
Girl, my love for you
Is true.
