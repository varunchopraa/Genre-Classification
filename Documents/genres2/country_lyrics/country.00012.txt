It all started in this little town way down in Texas
When he old Johnny Cash
Singing hectic country blues
He picked his guitar every night
And read them country magazines
Keeping up to snuff on the Music City news
One predetermined Sunday found him on the streets of Nashville
Humming out the chorus to his latest melody
He whooped through old Tootsie's bar and informed the local pickers
How he'd come to capture Music City, U.S.A.
Can't you hear the music ringing?
Can't you hear the singers singing?
Can't you hear somebody humming out my homemade melody?
The lost and found are searching there
And some new face from everywhere
Is come to capture Music City, U.S.A.
That Sunday evening found him in a corner booth at Limebaugh's
Drinking coffee and eating chili just like Earnest Tubb
Tuning up his guitar, Lord he couldn't wait till Monday
He figured if he couldn't make it, nobody could
Can't you hear the music ringing?
Can't you hear the singers singing?
Can't you hear somebody humming out my homemade melody?
The lost and found are searching there
And some new face from everywhere
Is come to capture Music City, U.S.A.
The years have come and gone since I seen him in ol' Nashville
Walking up 17th and 16th Avenue
Bugging everybody there that he could get to listen
Trying hard to do exactly what he'd said he'd come to do
Now the radios are ringin' with the songs that he was singin'
Everybody here's a-hummin' out his homemade melodies
That crazy fool with shaggy hair spread his songs out everywhere
I reckon he done captured Music City, U.S.A
