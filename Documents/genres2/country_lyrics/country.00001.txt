I tell you what, we're in a rut we're in a deep rut
So habitual, predictable I tell you what we oughta do
We oughta drive away, fly away, find a way to get away
We need a break from the same old, same old nothin' new
Wanna go out on a limb on a whim, yeah
That's the kind of mood I'm in
Let's go somewhere, nowhere we've heard of
Hang the sign out, ?Do not disturb us?
Get a wake up call about three p.m.
That's the kind of mood I'm in
A little shake up, take the chain and rattle it
Try to catch the wind and saddle it
Fall in love all over again, yeah
That's the kind of mood I'm in
I tell you this, I want a kiss, I want a long kiss
The kind of deep down, move the ground thing you used to do to me
I wanna dance a little, dream a little, baby just live a little
Make my heart rate elevate, bring it up a few degrees
Get me gone with the wind now and then, yeah
That's the kind of mood I'm in
Let's go somewhere, nowhere we've heard of
Hang the sign out, ?Do not disturb us?
Get a wake up call about three p.m.
That's the kind of mood I'm in
A little shake up, take the chain and rattle it
Try to catch the wind and saddle it
Fall in love all over again, yeah
That's the kind of mood I'm in
Any hemisphere, change of atmosphere
Get me outta here right now
Let's go somewhere, nowhere we've heard of
Hang the sign out, ?Do not disturb us?
Get a wake up call about three p.m.
That's the kind of mood I'm in
A little shake up, take the chain and rattle it
Try to catch the wind and saddle it
Fall in love all over again, yeah
Over and over again
That's the kind of mood I'm in, yeah
Oh, that's the kind of mood I'm in
