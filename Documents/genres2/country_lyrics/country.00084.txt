Oh yeah, sure, no problem
I'll just throw away these feelings
Let go of all these hopes
And never think of you
No offense, but you've lost it
If you think I'll just forget you
And decide that I don't love you
Do you realize what you're tellin' me to do
It's like sayin' don't breathe
Or don't blink
Well darlin', I don't think you understand
See, I can't just turn this off
It's like sayin' don't eat
Or don't sleep
Our love's just one of those things
That I've gotten used to doin' way too long
You don't have to worry
I'm not gonna stop you
You can pack up all your things
And head on out that door
But don't stand there and tell me
How you think it would be best
To leave my feelings in the past
And not allow myself to love you anymore
It's like sayin' don't breathe
Or don't blink
Well darlin', I don't think you understand
See, I can't just turn this off
It's like sayin' don't eat
Or don't sleep
Our love's just one of those things
That I've gotten used to doin' way too long
It's like sayin' don't eat
Or don't sleep
Our love's just one of those things
That I've gotten used to doin' way too long
