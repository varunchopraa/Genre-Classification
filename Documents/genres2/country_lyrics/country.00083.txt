There's an old Kodak camera in my dresser drawer
I ran across it just this afternoon
And I realize that I don't ever use it anymore
In fact last time I did I think it was with you
When we were down in Cozumel
We had the whole beach to ourselves
And it's crazy just to think
That it's all there on that film
And I could take it to the store
To be developed, but what for
I can still see everything just fine
And who needs pictures with a memory like mine
Standin' there, I couldn't help but think about
Everything that might be on that roll
I think it even has another trip we took
I guess that must've been at least three years ago
When we were down in Baton Rouge
And there wasn't much to do
So we drove into New Orleans every afternoon
And I swear that you would think
That it was only yesterday
Cause I can still see everything just fine
Who needs pictures with a memory like mine
And somewhere in my closet
There's a cardboard box just sittin' on the shelf
It's full of faded memories
And it's been there ever since the night you left
Just forgotten photographs
To remind me of the past
But I can still see everything just fine
And who needs pictures with a memory like mine
Yeah, who needs pictures with a memory like mine
