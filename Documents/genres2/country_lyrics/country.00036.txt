Through the window
He sits watching
His last sunset
Like a blackout curtain
Closing out the light
It's now
He needs someone's arms around him
Yes it's now
He needs someone
To help him through the night
An all night lady
One who loves me
And won't leave me
When daylight comes
One who'll stay with me
Until my life is done
At 9 AM they're going to lead him
To the death house
And at 10 AM
They'll lay his soul to rest
I can see them
Giving him his last supper
I can hear him giving them
His last request
An all night lady
One who loves me
And won't leave me
When daylight comes
One who'll stay with me
Until my life is done
One who'll stay with me
Until my life is done
