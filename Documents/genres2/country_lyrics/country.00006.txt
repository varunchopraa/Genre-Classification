If you really want to know
She comes here a lot
She just loves to hear the music and dance
K13 is her favorite song
If you play it, you might have a chance
Tonight she's only sippin' white wine
She's friendly, and fun lovin' most of the time
But don't ask her on a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him, and she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
Here's a glass of Chablis, and some quarters and change
Maybe you can turn her love life around
Then she won't need the salt or the lime anymore
To shoot that old memory down
Just remember her heart's on the mend
So if you ever come back to see her again
Don't ask her on a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him, then she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
Don't ask her on a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him, then she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
Don't ask her on a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him, and she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
Don't ask her on a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him, and she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
