Well, I met a gal from Old Kentucky
She was happy and go-lucky
Sally let your bangs hang down
She called me honey-bunny
Just to make me spend my money
Sally let your bangs hang down

Sally she could land 'em
She'd love them and she'd leave them
Sally let your bangs hang down
I'll find out what Sally's got
Makes a man think she's so hot
Sally let your bangs hang down

Now I'll haveta be confessin'
Sally always kept me guessin'
Sally let your bangs hang down
She jumped up on a fanny
And she rode away with Willie
Sally let your bangs hang down

He saw Sally changin' clothes
She was in a perfect pose
Sally let your bangs hang down
She caught me a-peepin' in
I don't think it was a sin
Sally let your bangs hang down

Sally she can land 'em
She loves 'em and she leaves 'em
Sally let your bangs hang down
I'll find out what Sally's got
Makes a man think she's so hot
Sally let your bangs hang down

Sally she can land 'em
She loves 'em and she leaves 'em
Sally let your bangs hang down
We'll find out what Sally's got
Makes a man think she's so hot
Sally let your bangs hang down
