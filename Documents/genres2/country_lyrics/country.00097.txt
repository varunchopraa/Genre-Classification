Girl you were always my yellow rose
And I was your one lone star
We always said
Together till death do us part
We had a love bigger than Texas
Where is that feeling now
It's taken some hits and some losses but it's fighting on
And standing somehow
Remember the man who asked for your hand
In the moonlight of San Antone
There by the mission you let your position be known
That you loved me so
Don't forget where it started
Remember the Alamo
I think we can hold on and make it togther
If we remember when
And get back to love
The way that it was back then
When we were hopeless romantics needing eachother
Willing to take a chance
We strolled and we talked down the ol' river walk
To the heart of where it began
Remember the man who asked for your hand
In the moonlight of San Antone
There by the mission you let your position be known
That you loved me so
Don't forget where it started
Remember the Alamo
