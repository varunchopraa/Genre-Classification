Today I started lovin' you again
And I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again
What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come
And the crying time for me had just begun
Today I started loving you again
I'm right back to where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again
