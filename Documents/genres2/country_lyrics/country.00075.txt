I gotta run to keep from hidin'
I'm bound to keep on ridin'
An' I got one more silver dollar
An' I ain't gonna let 'em catch me, no
I ain't gonna let em catch the midnight rider
Well, these ain't my clothes I'm wearin'
An' this ol' road goes on forever
An' I got one more silver dollar
An' I ain't gonna let 'em catch me, no
I ain't gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
Well, I've gone by the point of carin'
Some ol' bed, I'll soon be sharin'
An' I got one more silver dollar
An' I ain't gonna let 'em catch me, no
I ain't gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
An' I ain't gonna let 'em catch me, no
I ain't gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me, no
I ain't gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me, no
I ain't gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
I ain't gonna let 'em catch me, no
I ain't gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
