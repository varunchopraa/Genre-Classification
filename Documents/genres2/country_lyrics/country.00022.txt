Love me with all of your heart, that's all I want, love.
Love me with all of your heart, or not at all.
Just promise me this, that you'll give me all your kisses
Every winter, every summer, every fall...
When we are far apart or when you're near me
Love me with all of your heart as I love you
Don't give me your love for a moment or an hour
Love me always as you've loved me from the start
With every beat of your heart...
Just promise me this, that you'll give me all your kisses
Every winter, every summer, every fall...
When we are far apart or when you're near me
Love me with all of your heart as I love you
Don't give me your love for a moment or an hour
Love me always as you've loved me from the start
With every beat of your heart...
