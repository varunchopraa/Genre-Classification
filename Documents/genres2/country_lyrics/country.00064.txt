If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, and yet I know
I'll think of you each step of the way
And I will always love you
I will always love you
Bittersweet memories
That's all I have, and I'm taking with me
Goodbye, please don't you cry
Cause we both know, I'm not what you need
But, I will always love you
I will always love you
I hope life (I hope life)
Treats you kind (treats you kind)
And I hope you have all you dream of
I wish you joy (I wish you joy)
And happiness (and happiness)
But above all this, I wish you love, oh
And I will always love you
I will always love you
Yes, I will always love you
I will always love you
