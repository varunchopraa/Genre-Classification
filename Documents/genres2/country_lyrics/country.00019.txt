Now I lay me down to sleep
And if I sleep, perhaps I'll dream.
If I dream, I'll be with you,
In the shelter of your arms.
I pray that god will lengthen night,
And grant me time before the light.
For the light of day will take me
From the shelter of your arms.
And though I know it's just a dream,
A dream that soon must end,
The arms I feel, I know are real,
And I'm happy, once again.
If I die, while I am asleep,
I pray my dreams he'll let me keep,
And carry me through eternity
In the shelter of your arms.
And though I know it's just a dream,
A dream that soon must end,
The arms I feel, I know are real
And I'm happy, once again.
And if I die while I am asleep,
I pray my dreams he'll let me keep,
And carry me through eternity
In the shelter of your arms
