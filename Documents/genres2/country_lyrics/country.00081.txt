They've read the scriptures, they've passed the plate
They've sung the anthem, they've passed the plate
And we're both prayin' he don't preach late
But he's gettin' amens, that's just our luck
It's eighty five degrees outside and he's just gettin' warmed up
And you and me, we could be soakin' up that sun
Findin' out just how fast your brother's boat will run
I'll tell you there ain't nothin' that'll test your faith
Like a long sermon on a pretty sunday
Well it's been rainin' all week long
Woke up this mornin', dark clouds were gone
We both been raised not to miss church
But on a day like today heaven knows how much it hurts
And you and me, we could be soakin' up that sun
Findin' out just how fast your brother's boat will run
I'll tell you there ain't nothin' that'll test your faith
Like a long sermon on a pretty sunday
See that sunlight shinin' through that stained glass
How much longer is this gonna last
And you and me, we could be soakin' up that sun
Findin' out just how fast your brother's boat will run
I'll tell you there ain't nothin' that'll test your faith
Like a long sermon on a pretty sunday
