Sleepin' on the foldout thanks to me and my big mouth
Why did I do what I did
I shoulda known better than to lie
But it's too late and so tonight I'm
Sleepin' on the foldout sofa-bed
She wanted me to go and see her family
But I told her that I had to work
I never dreamed she'd get home so dang early
And she caught me cleanin' fish
Out on our back porch
(And now I'm)
Sleepin' on the foldout thanks to me and my big mouth
Why did I do what I did
I shoulda known better than to lie
But it's too late and so tonight I'm
Sleepin' on the foldout sofa-bed
I can't believe they call this thing a mattress
It's two a.m. and I'm wide awake
Lookin' back, I shoulda just been honest
Instead of tellin' her the whole staff
Spent the day out on the lake
(And now I'm)
Sleepin' on the foldout thanks to me and my big mouth
Why did I do what I did
I shoulda known better than to lie
But it's too late and so tonight I'm
Sleepin' on the foldout sofa-bed
