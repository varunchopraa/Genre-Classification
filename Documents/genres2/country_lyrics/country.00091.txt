West Texas forecast more of the same
Sunny and mild with no chance of rain
That old John Deere tractor ain't moved in days
Oh but he's out there climbin' back on
'Cause he's yet to admit that his crops are all gone
She stares out the window fightin' back tears
And watches him wastin' his time in the fields
They're havin' problems payin' the bills
And she knows that it won't be long
Before the bank finally places a lien on the farm
And the tractor keeps rolling
The dust rises high
Creating the only cloud in the sky
He's holding his ground
But it's gettin' tough
He's keepin' his faith
In the lord up above
And prayin' for rain
Through a cloud of dust
Yesterday somethin' in town caught his eye
The old hardware store had a help wanted sign
He thought about stoppin' but he drove on by
'Cause he just can't bear to let go
After all it's the only life he's ever known
And the tractor keeps rolling
The dust rises high
Creating the only cloud in the sky
He's holding his ground
But it's gettin' tough
He's keepin' his faith
In the lord up above
And prayin' for rain
Through a cloud of dust
