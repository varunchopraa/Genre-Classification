If I promise you to straightin' up and put my life in order
If I swear to you woman on bendin' knees I won't hurt you again
If I become the kind of man that you want me to be
Would you take another chance on me?
The good lord knows I've done you wrong I've asked him to forgive me
Deep inside I think he would if you could do the same
If I could take back all the things that caused you misery
Would you take another chance on me?
Would you take another chance on me?
I've paid for my mistake
Would you take another chance on me?
Or have I changed to late?
Mmmm I've been a fool woman for hurting you
But God can't you see I'm sorry?
If you were only mine again
I'd make it up to you
But my past keeps blinding you
If you could only see
Would you take another chance on me?
Think about it darlin
