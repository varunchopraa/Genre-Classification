Teach me to cheat, show me how you do it
I want to learn from the very best the one who cheats on me
Oh teach me to lie never bat an eye
Make me a honky-tonk angel teach me to cheat

Do I take the ring off of my finger?
Is that the way that all good cheaters do?
Do I sit down at the bar or at a table?
I just don’t know that’s why I’m asking you

Teach me to cheat, show me how you do it
I want to learn from the very best the one who cheats on me
Oh teach me to lie never bat an eye
Make me a honky-tonk angel teach me to cheat

Would you mind if I used your favorite motel?
When we sign in do we use Smith or Jones?
Would a drink or two make me feel as guilty?
And which lie do I tell you when I come home?

Teach me to cheat, show me how you do it
I want to learn from the very best the one who cheats on me
Teach me to lie never bat an eye
Make me a honky-tonk angel teach me to cheat
Make me a honky-tonk angel teach me to cheat
