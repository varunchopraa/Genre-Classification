Darlin' after you left I got that promotion
They transferred me out to La Jolla right on the ocean
And now I'm makin' more money than I can stand
I've got a house on the beach and a bunch of new friends
Oh, you oughta hear what they say
Tellin' me that I've got it made
But
I've been better
Yeah, I miss those times when we were still together
Right now lookin' back
I don't think the past has ever been this clear
And I realize sittin' here, as I write this letter
Oh, I've been better
Well I've been seein' a girl that I met out in Spring Valley
She's havin' the time of her life, least that's what she tells me
She says it's love and to tell you the truth
I've tried my best to feel that way too
Oh, but I always realize
When I look into her eyes
That
I've been better
Yeah, I miss those times when we were still together
Right now lookin' back
I don't think the past has ever been this clear
And I realize sittin' here, as I write this letter
Oh, I've been better
I've been better
Yeah, I miss those times when we were still together
Right now lookin' back
I don't think the past has ever been this clear
And I realize sittin' here, as I write this letter
Oh, I've been better
