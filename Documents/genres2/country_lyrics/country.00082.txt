Darling I've been standing here just watching you all night
And I think I've even caught you watching me a couple times
If I don't ask I'll never know
This may sound dumb but here we go
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Me neither I'm glad that we agree
Believe me that's a big relief
Well this place is awful crowded
And this music is so loud
Would you like to go and grab a bite to eat?
Me neither
It's nice to finally meet a girl who doesn't move too fast
I was only checking that's the reason that I asked
Relationships need time to grow
You and I should take this slow
Darling tell me would you like to dance?
Me neither I was just bein' polite
Thank goodness my feet are much too tired
I'm sure your tired too
I can see an empty booth
Would you like to maybe sit and talk awhile?
Me neither
We'd never get along
I'm thinking there's no chemistry at all
This has been a waste of time
And I'm running out of lines
Don't you think it's time for me to end this song?
Me neither
