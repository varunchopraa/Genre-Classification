I don't want to be standing here
With this ticket for this outbound plane
'Cause I've been here before
But somehow it doesn't feel the same
Talk is cheap, so we could talk all night long
We may never figure out just where our love went wrong
I don't want to be standin' here
And I don't want to be talkin' here
And I don't really care who's to blame
'Cause if love won't fly on its own free will
Its gonna catch that outbound plane
The old folks say loves not forever anymore
Because these young people walk away
From love alone, to pace the floor
Young or old I say that love is still the same
And you may walk away from love
But you'll fall head and heel again
Two lonely hearts in this aiport knowing
Neither cares where that other heart is going
But if love won't fly on its own free will
Its gonna catch that outbound plane
Hat crown you're wearin'
Is just your halo turned upside down
Where is the laughter we once shared
Back in the lost and found
These broken wings are gonna leave me here
To stand my ground
You can have this ticket
For that lonely plane that's flyin' out
I don't want to be standin' here
And I don't want to be talkin' here
And I don't really care who's to blame
'Cause if love won't fly on its own free will
Its gonna catch that outbound plane
