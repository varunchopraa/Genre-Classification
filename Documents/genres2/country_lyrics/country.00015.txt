Well in North Carolina way back in the hills
Lived my old pappy and he had him a still
He brewed white lightning 'til the sun went down,
And then he'd fill him a jug mmm-hmm and pass it around
Mighty mighty pleasin' you're pappy's home-squeezin'
Bwsh, white lightnin'
Yeah the G-men, T-men, revenuers too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin' tryin' to book 'im but my pappy kept on cookin'
Bwsh, white lightnin'
Well I asked my old pappy why he called his brew
White lightnin' 'stead of mountain dew
I took a little sip and right away I knew
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue
Lightnin' started flashin', thunder started clashin'
Bwsh, white lightnin'
Yeah the G-men, T-men, revenuers too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin' tryin' to book 'im but my pappy kept on cookin'
Bwsh, white lightnin'
Well a city slicker came and said "I'm tough
I think I wanna taste that powerful stuff"
He took one shlug and he drank it right down
And I heard him a-moanin' as he hit the ground
Mighty mighty pleasin' you're pappy's home-squeezin'
Bwsh, white lightnin'
Yeah the G-men, T-men, revenuers too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin' tryin' to book 'im but my pappy kept on cookin'
