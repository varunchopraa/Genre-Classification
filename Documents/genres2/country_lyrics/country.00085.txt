When a single mom goes out on a date with somebody new
It always winds up feeling more like a job interview
My mama used to wonder if she'd ever meet someone
Who wouldn't find out about me and then turn around and run
I met the man I call my dad when I was five years old
He took my mom out to a movie and for once I got to go
A few months later I remember lying there in bed
I overheard him pop the question and I prayed that she'd say yes
And then all of a sudden ah it seemed so strange to me
How we went from something's missing to a family
Lookin' back all I can say about all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be
I met the girl who's now my wife about three years ago
We had the perfect marriage but we wanted somethin' more
Now here I stand surrounded by our family and friends
Crowded 'round the nursery window as they bring the baby in
And then all of a sudden ah it seemed so strange to me
How we had gone from something's missing to a family
Lookin' through the glass I think about the man that's standing next to me
And I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be
Lookin' back all I can say about all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be
I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be
'Cause he didn't have to be
You know he didn't have to be
