I'm lookin' for a lover
Who can rev his little engine up
He can have a '55 Chevy
Or a fancy little pick-up truck
He's got a cool Cadillac
With a jacuzzi in the back I'm in, oh yeah
'Cause I'm a classy little chassis
Who's a-huntin' for a heart to win
Oh, but if you want to win it
There's no speed limit
Just go faster, faster, don't be slow
Rev it up, rev it up 'til your engine blows
You win my love
You win my soul
You win my heart
Yeah, you get it all
You win my love
You make my motor run
You win my love, yeah you're number one
Oh, I'm a crazy little lady yeah the kind you just can't slow down
Oh no
I need a '65 cylinder racy little run around town
Oh, but if you want to win it
Babe, there's no speed limit
Just go faster, faster and don't be slow
Rev it up, rev it up 'til your engine blows
You win my love
You win my soul
You win my heart
Yeah, you get it all
You win my love
You make my motor run
You win my love, yeah you're number one, oh oh oh yeah
I want a heartbreak Harley
A full of steam dream machine
Or just a little late night
Sexy long stretch limousine
Oh, but if you want to win it
Babe, there's no speed limit
Just go faster, faster, don't be slow
Rev it up, rev it up 'til your engines blow
You win my love
You win my soul
You win my heart
Yeah, you get it all
You win my love
You make my motor run
You win my love, yeah you're number one
Oh you win my love
You win my love
Oh you win my love
You win my love
I said you win my love
You win my love
Baby you win my love
I said you win my love
Yeah you win my love
You win my love
