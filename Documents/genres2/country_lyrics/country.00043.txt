Well, I ain't Burt Reynolds and I ain't Tom Selleck;
I got bills up the pike and my car's an old relic.
I get Chevrolet pay but I've got a big smile
'Cause my little Baby loves me Cadillac style!
Well, I don't have a condo in Panama City.
You could say I'm a member of the Poor Boy Commitee.
But I kinda feel rich when I've been with her a while
'Cause my little Baby loves me Cadillac style!
Well, about ten thirty, Lord, she puts me in drive,
Turns all the lights down and man, alive!
All eight cylinders are firin' in line,
I'm never out of gas and I'm always on time!
Well, I ain't Goldfinger and I ain't Joe Fashion
And you can't buy much with the checks I'm cashin'.
So, people, if you wonder why I'm a-ridin' with a smile
It's 'cause my little Baby loves me Cadillac Style.

Yeah, my little Baby loves me Cadillac Style!
Well, my little Baby loves me Cadillac style!
