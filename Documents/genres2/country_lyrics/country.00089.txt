The bar was empty
I was sweeping up the floor
That's when she walked in
I said, I'm sorry but we're closed
And she said "I know,
But I'm afraid I left my purse
I said, I put one back behind the bar
I bet it's probably yours
And the next thing that I knew
There we were, lost in conversation
And before I handed her her purse
I said, You'll only get this back on one condition"
And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
The music played, we held each other close
And we danced
And from that moment
There was never any doubt
I had found the one
That I had always dreamed about
And then one evenin'
When she stopped by after work
I pulled a diamond ring out of the pocket of my shirt
And as her eyes filled up with tears
She said, this is the last thing I expected
And then she took me by the hand
And said, I'll only marry you on one condition
And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
The music played, we held each other close
And we danced
Like no one else had ever danced before
I can't explain what happened on that floor
But the music played
We held each other close
And we danced
Yeah, we danced
