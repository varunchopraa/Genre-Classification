This old highway seems so lonesome
When you're going where you've been
And a lonesome song can make you cry
Time and time again
By listenin' to a friend of mine
Ten years ago today
I'd have a better job
Than what I've got today
But the billboards on the highway
And the brake lights on the cars
Make me jump out on the highway
With my bag and my guitar
If she comes or if she goes
It doesn't matter anymore
Cause I'm ridin' my thumb to Mexico
Ridin' my thumb to Mexico
It don't matter when or how I go
I'll ride this thumb 'til I see her again
So I'm ridin' my thumb to Mexico
Well, the reason why she left me's
Not the reason that I'm here
I'm a travelin' kind of man
Just need a change of atmosphere
If there's any place I haven't been
At all that's where I'll go
So I'm ridin' my thumb to Mexico
Ridin' my thumb to Mexico
It don't matter when or how I go
I'll ride this thumb 'til I see her again
So I'm ridin' my thumb to Mexico
