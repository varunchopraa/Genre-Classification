You say you're surprised
I thought I'd write today
Pieces of my life
That time can't fade away
Land lies dry, Africa
And the clouds roll by, Africa
I held you every night
I believed in all you'd say
Now the dust blows in my eyes
But those dreams won't fade away
The sky burns red, Africa
Don't you cry, Africa
Africa
When you cry it rains ? Africa
Still the children smile, Africa
When you cry it rains, Africa
When the wild dogs howl, Africa
Still the clouds roll by, Africa
