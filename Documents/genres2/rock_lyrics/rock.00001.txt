Give me a kiss hello goodbye what's the difference? Just end everything
you say with a smile Wave goodbye hello - with that look in your eye
Forwards backwards back it down the drive the curtains in the window
wave goodbye hello there's that look in your eye and your crazy smile I
know you + you know me too I know everything that you're going through +
you know everything that I'm gonna do You know me + I know you. Give me
an invitation and I'll be there unless of course I have to be somewhere
Give me your wishlist let's shake hands, if you don't like it you can
have your money back
