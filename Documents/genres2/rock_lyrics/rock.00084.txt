How can I tell you 
To put it all in words 
There is so much left to say 
But the meaning slips away 
And how can I show you 
To see it through my eyes 
Don't deny that part of you 
That's been dying for it too 
How do I know if I give you too much 
Will I snare you away 
How do I know when to leave you alone 
When to beg you to stay 
I want to know 
Just how much love does it take 
To get to you 
I stand here ready to break 
Tell me, tell me 
How much love does it take 
Moment to moment 
I don't know where it stands 
Will I end up like the rest 
Well it's anybody's guess 
Can I persuade you 
So softly in a touch 
If it's all a waste of time 
Well I'm only wasting mine 
How do I know if I give you too much 
Will I scare you away 
How do I know when to leave you alone 
When to beg you to stay 
I want to know 
Just how much love does it take 
To get to you 
I stand here ready to break 
Tell me, tell me 
How much love does it take 
How do I know when to leave you alone 
When to beg you to stay 
I want to know 
Just how much love does it take 
To get to you 
I stand here ready to break 
Tell me, tell me 
Just how much love does it take 
It's up to you 
I stand here ready to break 
Tell me, tell me 
Oh tell me, tell me 
How much love does it take 
How much love does it take 
How much love
