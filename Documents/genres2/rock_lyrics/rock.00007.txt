Tore open the package it was an empty box
No meaning to me, just an empty box
Sender was a woman
Sender was a woman
She said, she's sending me everything that I, I
I never gave her before
She said, "Fill it up and send it back
Fill it up and send it back"
So I sent her back an empty box
A big mistake, sent back an empty box
Half in the shadows, half in the husky moonlight
And half insane just a sound
I cross them to a valley, a valley so dark
That when I look back, I can't see where I began
I can't see my hands, I don't even know if my eyes are open
In the mornin' I was by the sea
And I swam out as far as I could swim
Until' I was too tired to swim anymore
And then I floated
And tried to get my strength back
And then an empty box came floatin' by
An empty box and I crawled inside
Half in the shadows, half in the husky moonlight
And half insane just a sound in the night
Half in the shadows, half in the husky moonlight
And half insane just a sound
Alright
