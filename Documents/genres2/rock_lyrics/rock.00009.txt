Hangin' on a curtain
Swingin' like a clock
Big hand on the seven
The little hand on top
You said you like to hear me talk
You told me not to stop
You said you like to hear me talk
You told me not to stop
Little red feet with big blue toes
Let me put my hands inside your clothes
Little red feet with big blue toes
Let me put my hands inside your clothes
Cute buttons like pointy little teeth
Oh, don't bite please
Cute buttons like pointy little teeth
Oh, don't bite please
Little red feet with big blue toes
Let me put my hands inside your clothes
Hangin' on a curtain
Swingin' like a clock
Big hand on the seven
The little hand on top
Said you like to hear me talk
You told me not to stop
Said you like to hear me talk
You told me not to stop
