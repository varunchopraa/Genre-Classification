Lend me your ear while I call you a fool
You were kissed by a witch, one night in the wood
And later insisted your feelings were true
The witch's promise was coming
Believing he listened while laughing you flew
Leaves falling red, yellow, brown, all look the same
And the love you have found, lay outside in the rain
Washed clean by the water but nursing his pain
The witch's promise was coming
And you look and there's where for your own selfish gain
Keep looking, keep looking for somewhere to be
Well, you're wasting your time, they're not stupid like he is
Meanwhile leaves are still falling, you're too blind to see
You won't find it easy now, it's only fair
He was willing to cater to you, but you didn't care
You're waiting for more but you've already had your share
The witch's promise is turning
So don't you wait up for him, he's going to be late
