Fourteenth street and the garbage swirls like a cyclone
Three o'clock in the afternoon 
And I am going home
F-train is full of high school students
So much shouting, so much laughter
Last night's underwear 
In my back pocket
Sure sign of the morning after
Take me home
Take me home and leave me there
Think I'm going to cry, I don't know why
Think I'm going to sing myself a lullaby
Feel free to listen
Feel free to stare
I live in new york, new york 
The city that never shuts up
In the daylight everything is so gory
You can hear snatches of stranger's sorry stories
And I moved there from buffalo 
But that's nothing
The trico plant moved to mexico
Left my uncle standing out in the cold
Said here's your last paycheck 
Have fun growing old
Take me home
Take me home and leave me there
Think I'm going to cry, I don't know why
Think I'm going to sing myself a lullaby
Feel free to listen
Feel free to stare
Rockabye baby
In the tree top
When the wind blows
Cradle will rock
When the bough breaks
The cradle will fall
And down will come baby
Cradle and all
Youth is beauty
Money is beauty
Hell, beauty is beauty sometimes
It's the luck of the draw
It's the natural law
It's a joke
It's a crime
I was bored
You were bored
It was a meeting of the minds
Now it's three in the afternoon 
And I can't leave too soon
Saying thank you, I had a nice time
Take me home
Take me home and leave me there
Think I'm going to cry, I don't know why
Think I'm going to sing myself a lullaby
Feel free to listen
Feel free to stare
Rockabye baby
In the tree top
When the wind blows
Cradle will rock
When the bough breaks
The cradle will fall
And down will come baby
Cradle and all
Maybe I'll live my whole life
Just getting by
Maybe I'll be discovered
Maybe I'll be colonized
You could try to train me like a pet
You could try to teach me to behave
But I'll tell you, if I haven't learned it yet
I ain't gonna sit
I ain't gonna stay
Take me home
Take me home and leave me there
Think I'm going to cry, I don't know why
Think I'm going to sing myself a lullaby
Feel free to listen
Feel free to stare
