Oh, the heat is so great
It plays tricks with the eye
It turns the road into water 
Then from water to sky
And there's a crack in the concrete floor
It starts at the sink
There's a bathroom in a gas station 
And I've locked myself in it to think
Back in the city
The sun bakes the trash on the curb
The men are pissing in doorways
And the rats run in herds
And I've got a dream with your face in it
That scares me awake
I put too much on my table
And now I got too much a stake
And I might let you off easy
Yeah I might lead you on
I might wait for you to look for me
And then I might be gone
This where I come from and where I'm going 
And I'm lost in between
I might go up to that phone booth
And leave a veiled invitation on you machine
And you'll stop me, won't you
If you've heard this one before
The one where I surprise you 
By showing up at your front door
Saying "let's not ask what's next
Or how, or why"
I am leaving in the morning
So let's not be shy
Be shy
The door opens, the room winces
The housekeeper comes in without a warning
I squint at the muscular motel light
And say, hey good morning
As she jumps, her keys jingle
And she leaves as quickly as she came in
I roll over and taste the pillow with my grin
The sheets are twisted and damp
Well the heat is so great
And I swear I can feel the mattress
Sinking underneath your weight
Oh sleep is like a fever
And I'm glad when it ends
Oh, the road flows like a river
And pulls me around every bend
Stop me, won't you
If you've heard this one before
The one where I surprise you 
By showing up at your front door
Saying "let's not ask what's next
Or how, or why"
I am leaving in the morning
So let's not be shy
Be shy, oh shy
Ah, the heat is so great
It plays tricks with the eye
It turns road into water
Then from water to sky
And there's a crack in the concrete floor
And it starts at the sink
There's a bathroom in the gas station 
And I have locked myself
In it to think
And you'll stop me, won't you
If you've heard this one before
The one where I surprise you 
By showing up at your front door
Saying "let's not ask what's next
Or how, or why"
I am leaving in the morning
So let's not be shy
You'll stop me, won't you
If you've heard this one before
Oh, one where I surprise you 
By showing up at your front door
Saying "let's not ask what's next
How, or why"
I am leaving in the morning
So let's not be shy
Be shy, be shy, be shy
Shy, shy, shh, shh
