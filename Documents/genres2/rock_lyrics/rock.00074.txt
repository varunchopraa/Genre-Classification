I've got to stand up for myself
This society don't care about nobody else
I've got to be strong
Even if I know the feeling is wrong
I've got to not care
Even if I know this world is meant to share
Wait a minute, this is wrong
Even the birds still sing their faithful song
And your beauty lies within you
Look in the mirror baby
Look in the mirror baby
What you gonna do when your friends have gone away and deserted you
You'll have to be strong
24 hours can seem so long
You're taught to not care
And then not realize this world is meant to share
Wait a minute, this is wrong
Even the birds still sing their faithful song
And your beauty lies within you
Look in the mirror baby
Look in the mirror baby
We've got to stand up for ourselves
Even if a leader so cold wants to glory himself
We've got to be strong
Even if our reasons seem wrong
We've got to not care
Even if the world we know may not even
Be here
Hold it! It's wrong
Even the birds still sing their faithful song
And your beauty lies within you
Look in the mirror baby
Look in the mirror baby
You know I'd do almost anything you want
Hey, I try to give you everything you need
I'll see that it gets to you
I don't believe in many things
But in you I do
You know I'd do most anything you want
Every day I, I try to give you everything you need
We'll always be there for you
I don't believe in many things
But in you I do
