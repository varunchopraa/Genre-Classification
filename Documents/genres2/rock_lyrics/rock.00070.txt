When you're falling awake
And you take stock of the new day
And you hear your voice croak
As you choke on what you need to say
Well, don't you fret, don't you fear
I will give you good cheer
Life's a long song
Life's a long song
Life's a long song
If you wait then your plate I will fill
As the verses unfold 
and your soul suffers the long day
And the twelve o'clock gloom
Spins the room, you struggle on your way
Well, don't you sigh, don't you cry
Lick the dust from your eye
Life's a long song
Life's a long song
Life's a long song
We will meet in the sweet light of dawn
As the Baker Street train spills your pain
All over your new dress
And the symphony sounds 
underground puts you under duress
Well, don't you squeal as the heel
Grinds you under the wheels
Life's a long song
Life's a long song
Life's a long song
But the tune ends too soon for us all
