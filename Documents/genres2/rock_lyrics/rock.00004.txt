First I learned to crawl
And then some other strokes
I can never remember any real good jokes
Do you feel like swimming?
Do you feel like swimming?
Yes, right now
I know a way to swim all the way downtown
I know a way to swim all the way downtown
It's a lot like swimming the first time over your head
It gets easier when you move your arms and legs
And for air you lift your head, why don't we try it right now
Yes, right now
Yes, right now
Well, I know a way to swim all the way downtown
I know a way to swim all the way downtown
Well, I know a way to swim all the way downtown
I know a way to swim all the way downtown
We'll go by way of the garden
Fat with tomatoes and beans on the vine
Sweet like the way it was
Like swimming for the very first time
Do you feel like swimming?
Do you feel like swimming?
Well, I know a way to swim all the way downtown
I know a way to swim all the way downtown
I know a way to swim all the way downtown
I know a way to swim all the way downtown
Do you feel like swimming?
Do you feel like swimming?
