Secrets of lovers
Whisper tonight
Broken down angel
Got lost in the cold daylight
The city is screaming
And I look for your eyes
Someone to lean on through the night
Your music talks to me and hits me tonight
One candle burning, I hear you say
So let there be love
Let there be love, oh yeah
Love
Let there be love, ooh yeah
It heals and it hurts
She leads you to heaven's door
And leaves you for dirt
Someone to lean on, that's your own
Some magic conquers me and lives in my soul
She comes like an ocean, I hear you sing
Love will conquer anything
Let there be love
Let there be love, oh yeah
Love
Let there be love
The wall's down
They're coming down
I can't slow
I know it now
So stay now
Hold on
And I'm praying
So let there be love
Let there be love, oh yeah
Love
Let there be love, ooh yeah
I know what I want
I know what I feel
I know what I want, oh right
So let there be love
Let there be love, oh right
