You don't like crazy music, you don't like rocking
You just want to go to a movie show, and sit their holding hands
You're so square, baby I don't care
I don't know why my heart blips, I only know it does
I only want to love you baby, I guess its just because
You're so square, baby I don't care
You don't know any dance steps, but I do-a-ho-ho
I only know why I love you like I do-a-do-a-do-a-do
You don't like crazy music, you don't like rocking
You just want to go to a movie show, and sit their holding hands
You're so square, baby I don't care
Baby I don't care, baby I don't care
