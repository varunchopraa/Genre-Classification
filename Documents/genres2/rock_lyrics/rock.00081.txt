Baby if you really love me 
You had better understand 
That the silver in your pocket 
ain't no measure of a man 
And though the fortunes of our fathers 
We aspire to rise above 
When you're born into a breed 
you're signed in blood 
I'm a poor man's son, workin all night long 
Got a bad guitar and a simple song 
you're a rich man's daughter, look at what you've done 
You went and fell in love with a poor man's son 
Baby you were born in splendor 
To a house of wealth and fame 
Your mother was a spender 
And you grew up on a stage 
And girl you could've loved for money 
Could've fooled around for fame 
But you went and took a chance 
On the real thing 
And though the fortunes of our fathers 
We aspire to rise above 
When you're born into a breed 
you're signed in blood 
I'm a poor man's son, workin all night long 
Got a bad guitar and a simple song 
you're a rich man's daughter 
You're a rich man's daughter 
I'm a poor man's son 
I'm a poor man's son 
I'm a poor man's son 
(Poor man's son, workin' all night long) 
I'm a poor man's son 
A poor man's son 
(Poor man's son, workin' all night long) 
I'm a poor man's son 
I'm a poor man's son 
(Poor man's son, workin' all night long) 
I'm a poor man's son 
I'm a poor man's son 
(Poor man's son, workin' all night long) 
I'm a poor man's son 
I'm a poor man's son 
(Poor man's son, workin' all night long) 
I'm a poor man's son 
I'm a poor man's son 
(Poor man's son, workin' all night long) 
I'm a poor man's son 
I'm a poor man's son
