Two dreamers, what would it feel like to meet by light of day 
So lonely, wouldn't if feel right to love this night away 
Your name keeps echoing down this wishing well 
Wild hearts on an endless flight, set free in our dreams tonight 
Two souls drawn to the fire in desperate dreams 
Two hearts lost to desire's desperate schemes 
One girl lost in a reverie 
Lost love found in a memory 
Those nights live on forever 
Two fools lost in a desperate dream 
Torn pages, more than a memory, pieces of the past 
One vision, your image keeps haunting me, a love too good to last 
Your voice keeps echoing down this wishing well 
Wild hearts on an endless flight, set free our dreams tonight 
Two souls drawn to the fire in desperate dreams 
Two hearts lost to desire's desperate schemes 
One girl lost in a reverie 
Lost love found in a memory 
Those nights live on forever 
Two fools lost in a desperate dream 
One love divided burns brightly through the night 
Two dreams united until the morning light 
Two souls drawn to the fire in desperate dreams 
Two hearts lost to desire's desperate schemes 
One girl lost in a reverie 
Lost love found in a memory 
Those nights live on forever 
Two fools lost in a desperate dream 
Lost in a desperate dream 
It was a desperate dream 
Only a desperate dream
